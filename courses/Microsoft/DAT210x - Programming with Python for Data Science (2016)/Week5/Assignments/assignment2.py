# INFO: The locations map above should be too "busy" to really wrap your head around. This

# to behave differently on weekends:
#
# On Weekdays:
#   1. People probably don't go into work
#   2. They probably sleep in late on Saturday
#   3. They probably run a bunch of random errands, since they couldn't during the week
#   4. They should be home, at least during the very late hours, e.g. 1-4 AM
#
# On Weekdays:
#   1. People probably are at work during normal working hours
#   2. They probably are at home in the early morning and during the late night
#   3. They probably spend time commuting between work and home everyday

# only examining records that came in on weekends (sat/sun).

# You can use < and > to compare the string times, just make sure you code them as military time
# strings, eg: "06:00:00", "22:00:00": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock
#
# You might also want to review the Data Manipulation section for this. Once you have your filtered
# slice, print out its length:

# with maps, you know well that your X-Coordinate should be Longitude, and your Y coordinate
# should be the tower Latitude. Check the dataset headers for proper column feature names.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system#Geographic_latitude_and_longitude
#
# At this point, you don't yet know exactly where the user is located just based off the cell
# phone tower position data; but considering the below are for Calls that arrived in the twilight
# hours of weekends, it's likely that wherever they are bunched up is probably near where the
# caller's residence:

# TODO: Run K-Means with a K=1. There really should only be a single area of concentration. If you
# notice multiple areas that are "hot" (multiple areas the usr spends a lot of time at that are FAR
# apart from one another), then increase K=2, with the goal being that one of the centroids will
# sweep up the annoying outliers; and the other will zero in on the user's approximate home location.
# Or rather the location of the cell tower closest to their home.....
#
# Be sure to only feed in Lat and Lon coordinates to the KMeans algo, since none of the other
# data is suitable for your purposes. Since both Lat and Lon are (approximately) on the same scale,
# no feature scaling is required. Print out the centroid locations and add them onto your scatter
# plot. Use a distinguishable marker and color.

# Hint: Make sure you graph the CORRECT coordinates. This is part of your domain expertise.
