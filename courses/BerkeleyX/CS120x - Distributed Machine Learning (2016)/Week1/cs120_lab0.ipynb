To move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You will not need to solve any problems to complete this lab.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.\n\n** This notebook covers: **\n* *Part 1:* Attach class helper library\n* *Part 2:* Test Spark functionality\n* *Part 3:* Test class helper library\n* *Part 4:* Check plotting\n* *Part 5:* Check MathJax formulas"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ** Part 1: Attach and test class helper library **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### (1a) Install class helper library into your Databricks CE workspace\n- The class helper library \"spark_mooc_meta\" is published in the [PyPI Python Package repository](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) as [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spark_mooc_meta](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spark_mooc_meta)\n- You can install the library into your workspace following the following instructions:\n - Step 1: Click on \"Workspace\", then on the dropdown and select \"Create\" and \"Library\"\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Library1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n - Step 2 Enter the name of the library by selecting \"Upload Python Egg or PyPI\" and entering \"spark_mooc_meta\" in the \"PyPI Name\" field\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Library2.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n - Step 3 Make sure the checkbox for auto-attaching the library to your cluster is selected\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Library3.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ** Part 1: Test Spark functionality **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["** (1a) Create a DataFrame and filter it **\n\nWhen you run the next cell (with control-enter or shift-enter), you will see the following popup.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Cluster.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n\nSelect the click box and then \"Launch and Run\".
