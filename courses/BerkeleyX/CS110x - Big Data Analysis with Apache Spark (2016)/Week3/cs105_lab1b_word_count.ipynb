The volume of unstructured text in existence is growing dramatically, and Spark is an excellent tool for analyzing this type of data.  In this lab, we will write code that calculates the most common words in the [Complete Works of William Shakespeare](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page).  This could also be scaled to larger applications, such as finding the most common words in Wikipedia.\n\n** During this lab we will cover: **\n* *Part 1:* Creating a base DataFrame and performing operations\n* *Part 2:* Counting with Spark SQL and DataFrames\n* *Part 3:* Finding unique words and a mean value\n* *Part 4:* Apply word count to a file\n\nNote that for reference, you can look up the details of the relevant methods in [Spark's Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.sql)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["labVersion = 'cs105x-word-count-df-0.1.0'"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ** Part 1: Creating a base DataFrame and performing operations **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this part of the lab, we will explore creating a base DataFrame with `sqlContext.createDataFrame` and using DataFrame operations to count words."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["** (1a) Create a DataFrame **\n\nWe'll start by generating a base DataFrame by using a Python list of tuples and the `sqlContext.createDataFrame` method.  Then we'll print out the type and schema of the DataFrame.

To do this, we'll call the [`select` DataFrame function](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.select) and pass in a column that has the recipe for adding an 's' to our existing column.  To generate this `Column` object you should use the [`concat` function](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.functions.concat) found in the [`pyspark.sql.functions` module](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#module-pyspark.sql.functions).  Note that `concat` takes in two or more string columns and returns a single string column.  In order to pass in a constant or literal value like 's', you'll need to wrap that value with the [`lit` column function](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.functions.lit).\n\nPlease replace `<FILL IN>` with your solution.  After you have created `pluralDF` you can run the next cell which contains two tests.  If you implementation is correct it will print `1 test passed` for each test.\n\nThis is the general form that exercises will take.  Exercises will include an explanation of what is expected, followed by code cells where one cell will have one or more `<FILL IN>` sections.  The cell that needs to be modified will have `# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code` on its first line.  Once the `<FILL IN>` sections are updated and the code is run, the test cell can then be run to verify the correctness of your solution.

While this approach could work for small datasets, we want an approach that will work for any size dataset including terabyte- or petabyte-sized datasets.
