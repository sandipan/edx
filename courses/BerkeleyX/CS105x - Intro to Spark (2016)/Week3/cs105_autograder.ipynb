The built-in autograder provides you with immediate feedback about the correctness of your code.\n* Using the autograder notebook to submit a completed lab exercise to the course autograder. The course autograder runs the _exact_ same tests as the built-in notebook autograder. _There is no advantage to submitting to the course autograder until your code passes all built-in tests._\n* Submitting the submission ID from the course autograder on the edX course website. Submitting your submission ID on the edX course website will record your score for the assignment.\n\n** You must complete _all_ three steps to receive a score for a lab assignment. **\n\nThis notebook will show you how to register for the course autograder, prepare a lab notebook for submission to the course autograder, and submit a notebook for grading by the autograder.\n\nYou can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.\n\n#### ** Make sure you have completed the Lab 0 notebook before you run this notebook  - this notebook uses libraries that are installed when you complete Lab 0. **\n\n** This notebook covers: **\n* *Part 1:* Register for the course autograder\n* *Part 2:* Save your private token\n* *Part 3:* Submit a lab to the course autograder\n* *Part 4:* Check the status of the course autograder queue\n* *Part 5:* Get your submission ID for submitting on the edX course website\n* *Part 6:* Examine the autograder results for your submission"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Ignore the following cell.
