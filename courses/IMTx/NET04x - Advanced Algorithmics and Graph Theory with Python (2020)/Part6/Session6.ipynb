    "To ensure a win in a combinatorial game the simplest approach is to simulate all the possible playouts of the game. As this is too computationally expensive in this laboratory we are going to exploit all the possible playouts against a deterministic adversary. A deterministic adversary is an adversary that given a game state will always execute the same move. This simplification greatly reduces the amount of playouts to simulate.\n",
