To that end\, NorthRegentRx\nheld a licence from Health Canada to sell its products\, including the sale of\nLibidus\, one of its primary products\, which was marketed as a remedy for symptoms\nof erectile dysfunction.\n[3]              \nOn August 4\, 2006\, Health Canada directed NorthRegentRx to stop the sale of Libidus on the basis that the product had\nundisclosed acetildenafil\, which is an analogue of sildenafil (Viagra).\nNorthRegentRx complied with Health Canada__s direction\, but spent six years\ntrying to convince Health Canada that acetildenafil was not an ingredient of\nLibidus.\n[4]              \nHealth Canada__s decision to direct NorthRegentRx\nto stop the sale of Libidus led the Applicant\, together with her associates in\nNorthRegentRx\, to sue Health Canada in damages.  In that proceeding\, the\nplaintiffs alleged that the decision was the result of gross negligence\,\narbitrariness\, bad faith and malice on the part of Health Canada employees.  The plaintiffs also alleged that there was a conspiracy between Health Canada and the pharmaceutical industry to suppress the distribution of Libidus.  In a Judgment\nissued on January 22\, 2014\, this Court struck out the plaintiffs__ action on the\nbasis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action (see Swarath\nv Canada\, 2014 FC 75).\n[5]              \nA few weeks before launching that action\,\nthat is on March 9\, 2012\, the Applicant had filed an access to\ninformation request under the Act seeking the release of __all correspondence__ __ which she later clarified to be\nemails and memos only - between Paul Gustafson\, a Health Canada inspector with\nthe Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate\, and any other Health Canada\nofficers/branches regarding Libidus and NorthRegentRx over a period extending\nfrom July 2006 and January 2012 (the Access Request).\n[6]              \nThe statutory deadline for Health Canada to respond to the Access Request was April 8\, 2012. On April 4\, 2012\, Health Canada asked for a 120-day extension\, extending the deadline to reply to the Access Request\nto August 7\, 2012.  However\, this deadline could not be met.  Health Canada\nclaimed it need more time to process the Access Request as it required the\nprocessing and review of over 3\,000 pages of documents as well as external\nconsultations with three governmental entities.  According to the record\, these\nconsultations were initiated in May 2013 and completed in March 2014.  To that\npoint\, the Applicant__s file within Health Canada__s Access to Information and\nPrivacy Office had changed hands five times.\n[7]              \nOn April 3\, 2014\, the Applicant filed a\ncomplaint with the Information Commissioner of Canada (ICC)\, claiming that\nHealth Canada had failed to respond to the Access Request within the time\nframes set out in the Act and was therefore deemed to have refused access.  On\nOctober 23\, 2014\, the ICC reported on its investigation of the complaint\,\nconcluding that Health Canada had failed to comply with its __duty to assist__ under subsection 4(2.1) of the Act\nand had placed itself in a deemed refusal situation as per subsection 10(3) of\nthe Act as it had failed to respond to the Access Request within the statutory\ntimeframe.  However\, the ICC also concluded that as a result of its intervention\,\nHealth Canada had agreed to respond to the Access Request by October 31\, 2014\,\nwhich the ICC held to be a reasonable commitment under the circumstances of the\ncase.\n[8]              \nDue to alleged unexpected technical\ndifficulties\, the October 31\, 2014 deadline could not be met.  The commitment\ndate was first changed to November 18\, 2014 and then to mid-December\n2014\, and yet again to January 7\, 2015.\n[9]              \nOn December 15\, 2014\, the Applicant filed the\ncurrent proceedings\, seeking an order from this Court enjoining Health Canada\, in the context of the deemed refusal to process the Access Request\, to release the\nrequested records.  On January 29\, 2015\, Health Canada responded to the Access\nRequest by disclosing to the Applicant a redacted version of these records.\n[10]          \nThe Applicant filed her memorandum of\nfact and law in June 2015 in support of this review proceeding where she asked\nthe Court to order the release of an unredacted version of the requested\nrecords. The Applicant had previously filed a further complaint with the ICC\nregarding Health Canada__s decision to exclude information from the released\npackage.  However\, there is no evidence on record as to the status of that\ncomplaint.\n[11]          \nThe Respondent submits that given that Health\nCanada responded to the Access Request in January 2015\, the present proceeding\nis moot and ought to be dismissed.  It further claims that to the extent the\nCourt should decide to consider the present proceeding insofar as it might\npertain to the application of exemptions to the released records\, the said\nproceeding is premature.\nIII.            \nIssues\n[12]          \nThe main issue to be resolved in this case is\nwhether the release of the requested records in January 2015 has had the effect\nof rendering the Applicant__s review proceeding moot\, even if the records were\nreleased in a redacted form.\n[13]          \nIn the alternative\, that is if I were to\nconsider the Applicant__s review proceeding from the standpoint of the\napplication of exemptions to the released records\, as the Applicant now seems\nto be urging the Court to do\, the issue is whether the Applicant__s review\nproceeding is premature.\n[14]          \nGiven the current state of the law on both\nissues\, the Applicant__s review proceeding must\, unfortunately for her\, fail on\neither front.\nIV.            \nAnalysis\n[15]          \nSection 41 of the Act provides that any person\nwho has been refused access to a record may apply to the Court for a review of\nthe refusal.  In Statham v Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\, 2010 FCA\n315\, [2012] 2 FCR 421 (FCA) [Statham]\, the Federal Court of Appeal\nidentified three prerequisites that such a person must satisfy before applying\nto the Court under section 41 of the Act:\na. The applicant must have been\n""refused access"" to a requested record;\nb. The applicant must have complained to the\nICC about the refusal; and\nc. The applicant must have received a report\nof the ICC under subsection 37(2) of the Act.\n[16]          \nThese requirements reflect the common law\ndoctrine that\, absent exceptional circumstances\, all adequate and alternate\nremedies must be pursued before resorting to an application for judicial review\n(Whitty v Canada (Minister of the Environment)\, 2014 FCA 30\, at para 8 [Whitty]). \nThe complaint scheme to the ICC is one such adequate and alternate remedy.\n[17]          \nThis Court__s jurisdiction under section 41 of\nthe Act has been interpreted narrowly so that once the requested information\nhas been provided\, __there is no other remedy for the\nCourt to provide__ (Frezza v Canada (National Defense)\, 2014 FC\n32\, at para 56\, 445 FTR 299 [Frezza]).\n[18]          \nIn Information Commissioner of Canada v\nCanada (Minister of National Defence)\, 2014 FC 205\, rev__d on other grounds\n[2015] 2 FCR 786 \, rev__d  2015 CAF 56 [Information\nCommissioner of Canada]\, Justice Catherine Kane\, at paragraphs 63-73 of her\ndecision\, provided a useful snapshot of the mechanics of the regime established\nby the Act. While this decision was reversed on other grounds\, Justice Kane__s\noverview of the Act remains valid:\n[63] The Act sets out its purpose in section\n2. Section 6 governs how requests for records shall be made.\n[64] Under section 7 of the Act\, the head of\nthe government institution to which the request is made has\, subject to\nsections 8-10\, 30 days after the request is received to give notice to the\nrequester whether or not access to the record\, or part thereof\, will be given\nand if so\, to provide the records.\n[65]  Section 9 of the Act allows the head\nof a Government institution to extend the time limit set out in section 7 __for\na reasonable period of time\, having regard to the circumstances__ if there are a\nlarge number of records and if meeting the 30 day initial time limit would\ninterfere with the operations of the department\, or if consultations are\nrequired which cannot be completed within that period\, or if notice of the\nrequest is required to be given to a third party pursuant to subsection 27(1).\n[66] Section 10 governs refusals to give\naccess to the records and subsection 10(3) provides that where the records are\nnot provided within the time limits set out in this act\, the head of the\ninstitution is deemed to have refused to give access. In other words\, where\nthere is no outright notice of refusal\, if the requested records are not\nprovided within 30 days or within the period of time claimed as an extension\nunder section 9\, there is a deemed refusal.\n[67] Section 30 governs complaints\, i.e. who\ncan bring a complaint and on what grounds.\n[68] Sections 32-36 govern investigations by\nthe Information Commissioner\, including the requirements to notify the\nGovernment institution\, determine its procedure\, the privacy of complaints\, and\nthe opportunity for those affected to make submissions.\n[69] Section 37 sets out the powers of the\nInformation Commissioner regarding the results or findings of its\ninvestigation. The Information Commissioner may report her findings to the\nGovernment institution\, make recommendations\, and request a response. She must\nalso report to the requester and provide the requester__s response of the impugned\nGovernment institution.\n[70] Section 38 requires the Information\nCommissioner to provide an Annual Report to Parliament. The Information\nCommissioner may also submit Special Reports pursuant to section 39 on matters\nwithin the scope of its powers\, particularly on matters of importance that\nshould not wait until the next Annual Report to be highlighted.\n[71] Sections 41 and 42 provide that the\nrequester who has been refused access or the Information Commissioner\,\nfollowing an investigation\, may apply to the Court for review of a refusal.\n[72] In 2006\, the Act was amended to add\nsubsection 4(2.1) to impose a duty on the head of the institution to assist a requester\,\nincluding to provide __timely__ access to the requested record.\n[73] The Information Commissioner has no\nauthority to make any orders.\n[19]          \nHere\, the complaint to the ICC that led to the\nfiling of the review proceeding under section 41 of the Act concerned\nspecifically and exclusively Health Canada__s deemed refusal to respond to the\nAccess Request. However\, Health Canada has since responded to the Access\nRequest.  As is well-established\, the Court is empowered to decline to hear a\ncase where its decision will have no practical effect on the rights of the\nparties (Borowski v Canada (Attorney General)\, [1989] 1 SCR 342\, at para\n15\, 57 DLR (4h) 231) [Borowski].  This will generally be the case where\nthe live controversy that gave rise to the legal proceedings has disappeared. \nThis essential element of a live\, concrete and tangible controversy must be\npresent not only when the proceedings are commenced but also at the time the\nCourt is called upon to reach a decision (Borowski\, at para 15).\n[20]          \nIn the case at bar\, the deemed refusal to\nrespond to the Access Request is the only issue that was investigated and\nreported on by the ICC and the only issue that is __ and can be at this stage -\nbefore the Court.   The live controversy that led to the Applicant__s complaint to\nthe ICC and subsequent review proceeding __ the absence of a response to the\nAccess Request __ does not exist anymore now that a response to the\nRequest has been provided to the Applicant.  In such context\, granting the\nreview proceeding\, to the extent it concerns the deemed refusal to respond to\nthe Access Request\, would have no practical effect on the rights of the\nparties.\n[21]          \nThe Applicant claims that the review proceeding\nis not moot since Health Canada only partially responded to the Access\nRequest by disclosing a redacted version of the requested records.  She says\nthat she is entitled to a full version of these records and that the review\nproceeding seeks an order to that effect. However\, the case law makes it clear\nthat absent a prior investigation on the part of the ICC as to the manner in\nwhich Health Canada responded to the Access Request\, it is not open to the\nCourt to review the nature and content of the response\, however imperfect and\nincomplete the response may appear to be to the access requester (Statham\,\nabove\, at paras 23-24\, 28-30; Dagg v Canada (Minister of Industry)\, 2010\nFCA 316\, at para 13 [Dagg]; Information Commissioner of Canada\,\nabove at para 47).\n[22]          \n According to the mechanics of the regime\nestablished by the Act\, the Applicant__s demand for an order enjoining Health Canada to disclose an unredacted version of the requested records is therefore premature.  \nIn a review proceeding initiated under section 41 of the Act on the basis of a\ncomplaint of a deemed refusal\, the Court cannot rule upon the application of\nany exemption or exclusion claimed under the Act if the Commissioner has not\ninvestigated and reported on the claim to the exemption or exclusion (Statham\,\nabove at para 55; Whitty\, above\, at paras 8 and 9\,  Luk_cs v Natural\nSciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)\, 2015 FC 267\, at para\n31).\n[23]          \nHere\, the ICC limited her investigation\, as she\nwas bound to do given the nature of the Applicant__s complaint\, to requiring\nHealth Canada to respond to the Access Request so that the Applicant could then\nconsider the merits of whatever response was provided.  If not satisfied with\nthe response\, the Applicant was in turn entitled to make a further complaint to\nthe ICC\, as she appears to have done\, so that the ICC could consider the merits\nof any exemptions or exclusions claimed under the Act by Health Canada.   As previously indicated\, I have no evidence before me that this further complaint\nhas been investigated and reported on by the ICC.  At the hearing\, the\nApplicant could not confirm the status of this complaint.\n[24]          \nTherefore\, I have no choice but to find that the\nthird prerequisite that the Applicant had to satisfy before applying to the\nCourt under section 41 of the Act regarding the exemptions and exclusions\napplied by Health Canada to the requested records\, that is the issuance of a\nreport from the ICC\, has not been met (Statham\, above at para 64). The\nApplicant__s challenge to Health Canada__s decision not to disclose the __full__ record is therefore premature.  This is the\nlogic of the scheme established by the Act\, however imperfect and burdensome it\nmay be perceived to be by some.\n[25]          \nThe Applicant__s review proceeding is therefore\neither moot or premature and for these reasons\, ought to be dismissed.\n[26]          \nBoth parties are claiming costs.  Although the\nApplicant__s Notice of Application is silent on costs\, it is well-settled that a\nparty can ask for costs at any point during the proceeding\, even during the\nhearing (Balogun v Canada\, 2005 FCA 350\, at para 2).  That is what the\nApplicant has done by seeking costs in the written submissions she filed in\nsupport of the review proceeding and by reiterating this demand at the hearing.\n[27]          \nAccording to subsection 53(1) of the Act\, the\ncosts of all proceedings in the Court under the Act shall be at the\ndiscretion of the Court and shall follow the event unless the Court orders\notherwise.  Subsection 53(2) of the Act provides that it is open to the Court\nto award costs to the Applicant\, even if he/she has not been successful in the\nresult\, if it finds that the review proceeding __raised\nan important new principle in relation to [the] Act.__  The present case\nis no doubt important to the Applicant but it does not raise an important new\nprinciple in relation to the Act\, as contemplated by subsection 53(2).\n[28]          \nThat being said\, I am of the view that\, in the\nparticular circumstances of this case\, each party shall bear its costs.  One\nthe one hand\, as was the case in Dagg\, above\, the review proceeding was\nneither moot nor premature when it was commenced in December 2014.  The three\nprerequisites under section 41 of the Act were all met.  The review proceeding\nwas rendered moot when Health Canada responded to the Access Request after the\nreview proceeding was commenced. This was nearly three years after the Access\nRequest had been filed.   In Dagg\, the Federal Court of Appeal found\nthat in these circumstances\, the Court should have ordered that Mr. Dagg was\nentitled to costs.\n[29]          \nHealth Canada claims that this case does not\nmerit an award of costs for the Applicant as it made significant efforts to\nrelease the requested records by the commitment date of October 31\, 2014 and\nprior to the commencement of the review proceeding.  It contends that these\nefforts were thwarted by the volume of the Access Request\, the high number of\ndocuments collected for review and processing\, the complexity of the records\,\nthe requirement for multiple consultations\, and internal technical\ndifficulties.\n[30]          \nHowever\, the evidence also shows that the Access\nRequest had changed hands at least five times within Health Canada__s Access to\nInformation and Privacy Office and that the ICC found Health Canada to have\nfailed to comply with its __duty to assist__ under\nsubsection 4(2.1) of the Act.  Furthermore\, the initial commitment date of\nOctober 31\, 2014 had been changed on two occasions before the Applicant finally\ndecided to file the review proceeding.  In these circumstances\, that decision\nwas not unreasonable\, abusive\, or vexatious.  As in Dagg\, when her\nreview proceeding became moot at the end of January 2015\, the Applicant was\nentitled to costs.\n[31]          \nOn the other hand\, contrary to Dagg\,\nwhere the applicant conceded that his application under section 41 of the Act\nhad become moot and was only pursuing his application in order to seek costs (Dagg\,\nat paras 5 and 13)\, the Applicant insisted to proceed further by seeking an\norder enjoining Health Canada to release an unredacted version of the requested\nrecords.  This was an ill-advised decision as this endeavour\, for the reasons\nmentioned above and assuming it was properly before the Court\, was bound to\nfail and indeed failed.\n[32]          \nIn these circumstances\, exercising the\ndiscretionary power vested in the Court by subsection 53(1) of the Act\, I find\nthat neither party should benefit from a costs award.  The Applicant__s review\nproceeding shall therefore be dismissed without costs. \n\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURT__S JUDGMENT is that the\njudicial review application is dismissed\, without costs.\n""Ren_ LeBlanc""\n\nJudge\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL\nCOURT\nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCKET:\n\n\nT-2543-14\n\n\n\n\nSTYLE OF\n  CAUSE:\n\n\nCAROL\n  LOVERNE SHELDON v MINISTER OF HEALTH (CANADA)\n\n\n\n\nPLACE OF\n  HEARING:\n\n\nWinnipeg\, Manitoba\n\n\n\n\nDATE OF\n  HEARING:\n\n\nNovember 3\, 2015\n\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT\n  AND REASONS:\n\n\nLEBLANC J.\n\n\n\n\nDATED:\n\n\nDECEMBER 15\, 2015\n\n\n\nAPPEARANCES:\n\n\n\nCarol Loverne Sheldon\n\n\nFor\n  The Applicant\nSelf-represented\n\n\n\n\nDhara Drew\n\n\nFor\n  The Respondent\n\n\n\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD:\n\n\n\nCarol Loverne Sheldon\nGonor\, Manitoba\n\n\nFor\n  The Applicant\nSelf-represented\n\n\n\n\nWilliam F.

They carried on business under the name\nNorthRegentRx. NorthRegentRx held a license\, issued by Health Canada\, to sell\nsuch products. \n[3]  \nIn 2006\, the plaintiffs__ primary product was\n__Libidus__\, described as a natural health product intended to increase blood\ncirculation and address symptoms of erectile dysfunction and enhance sexual\nperformance. Health Canada issued a direction to the plaintiffs on August 4\,\n2006 under the Natural Health Products Regulations\, SOR/2003-196 to stop\nthe sale of Libidus in Canada and to recall all of the product that had been\ndistributed to retail outlets. The ground apparently cited for the issuance of\nthe direction was that Libidus contained undisclosed acetildenafil\, an\nanalogue of sildenafil (Viagra)\, a controlled substance. Other similar\nsubstances or adulterants were later said by Health Canada to be found in the\nproduct.\n[4]  \nThe plaintiffs complied with the direction and\nstopped selling Libidus. Over the course of the ensuing six years\, they\nattempted to persuade Health Canada that its analysis was incorrect by\, among\nother things\, submitting independent laboratory analyses that contradicted the\nHealth Canada findings. Health Canada did not accept the plaintiffs__ analyses\nand declined to revoke the direction and issue a license. There is no\nindication in the record that the plaintiffs sought relief from those decisions\nby way of a notice of application seeking judicial review. The exchange of\ncorrespondence with Health Canada is not part of the record before the Court.\n[5]  \nOn August 2\, 2012\, the plaintiffs filed a\nStatement of Claim against the defendants for general damages in the amount of\n$77\,144\,036.00\, punitive damages of $25\,000\,000.00\, pre and post-judgment\ninterest\, and for an Order directing the defendant\, Health Canada\, to issue a\nlicense to the plaintiffs permitting them to market and distribute Libidus in\nCanada. The plaintiffs alleged gross negligence\, arbitrariness\, bad faith and\nmalice on the part of Health Canada employees\, and a conspiracy between the\ndefendants and the pharmaceutical industry to suppress the distribution of\nLibidus.\n[6]  \nThe defendants filed this motion to strike on September\n28\, 2012\, under Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules. The matter was\nthen adjourned several times\, on each occasion but one at the request of the\nplaintiffs\, before being set down for hearing peremptorily on January 20\, 2014.\nDue to those adjournments and a change of plaintiffs__ counsel in October 2013\,\nthe responding motion materials were not filed until January 16\, 2014. Pursuant\nto Rule 8 of the Federal Courts Rules\, the time to file and serve those\nmaterials is extended. \n[7]  \nThe defendants seek an Order striking the claim\nin its entirety for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action. In\nparticular\, the defendants submit that the claim is deficient in that:\na) it appears to advance a tort claim based solely upon alleged\nbreach of statute\, a tort not known at law;\nb) the tort claim is framed as one of direct liability against the\nCrown\, not vicarious liability on the part of the Crown for an identifiable\nCrown servant;\nc) none of the causes of action in tort asserted in the claim are\nsufficiently or adequately pleaded; and\, \nd) the circumstances of this case do not give rise to an actionable\nprivate law duty of care.\n \n[8]  \nThe Court may\, at any time on motion\, order\nunder Rule 221(1)(a) that a pleading be struck\, with or without leave to amend\,\non the ground that it does not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The\nparties are agreed that the test for motions to strike is that set out by the\nSupreme Court of Canada in Knight v Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd\, 2011\nSCC 42\, [2011] 3 SCR 45 at para 17:\n[17]   [__] A claim will only be struck if it is plain and obvious\,\nassuming the facts pleaded to be true\, that the pleading discloses no\nreasonable cause of action [__]. Another way of putting the test is that the\nclaim has no reasonable prospect of success. Where a reasonable prospect of\nsuccess exists\, the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial [Citations\nremoved].\n \n[9]  \nThere are a number of evident deficiencies with\nthe pleadings that counsel for the plaintiffs submits could be cured by\namendment. As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Simon v Canada\,\n2011 FCA 6 at para 8\, any defect in the statement must be one that is not\ncurable by amendment in order for a pleading to be struck without leave to\namend.\n[10]    Potential tort liability for the Federal Crown on the alleged facts\ncould arise from sections 3(b)(i) and 10 of the Crown Liability and\nProceedings Act\, RSC 1985\, c C-50. That liability is vicarious and\ndependent upon a tort committed by a servant of the Crown. With the exception\nof a reference to the employees of Health Canada at paragraph 17\, the claim is\nframed as one of direct liability against the Crown. As argued by the\ndefendants\, absent an alleged tort committed by an identified Crown servant for\nwhich tort the Crown is vicariously liable\, the claim does not disclose a\nreasonable cause of action. \n[11]    Moreover\, the allegations of misfeasance in public office\, at\nparagraph 31 of the claim\, fail in any way to identify the responsible\nofficials. The plaintiffs are required\, under Rule 174\, to plead material facts.\nThe identities of the individuals who are alleged to have engaged in\nmisfeasance are material facts that must be pleaded. The claim refers to six\nyears of correspondence with Health Canada in an effort to have the direction\nset aside. This presumably put the plaintiffs in possession of the names of the\nindividuals or groups that were dealing with the matter\, or at least their job\npositions\, branches or offices. Identification of at least that level of\nparticularity would have been sufficient: Merchant Law Group v Canada\n(Revenue Agency)\, 2010 FCA 184. However\, particulars of that nature do not\nappear in the claim.\n[12]    Further\, the pleading does not adequately describe the other parties\nto the conspiracy alleged at paragraph 21\, other than a vague reference to the\n__pharmaceutical industry and/or other persons unknown__. It does not allege the\nagreement between the defendants to conspire\, the purpose or objects of the\nconspiracy\, and the overt acts which are alleged to have been done by each of\nthe alleged conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy: Key Property\nManagement Inc v Middlesex Condominium Corp No 134\, 1991 CarswellOnt 451 at\npara 10 citing Bullen\, Leake and Jacob__s Precedents of Pleadings\, 12th\ned (London: Sweet & Maxwell\, 1975) at p 341.\n[13]   \nThe claim includes allegations at paragraphs 26\nand 32 that the defendants breached their statutory duty to comply with the\nlegislation and regulations governing drug usage and natural health products.\nThe defendants contend that these allegations appear to assert a claim based\nupon alleged breach of statute and/or regulation\, a tort unknown in Canada.\nHowever\, proof of statutory breach\, causative of damages\, may be evidence of\nnegligence if a tort committed by Crown servants could be established: R v\nSaskatchewan Wheat Pool\, [1983] 1 SCR 205 at para 42. Moreover\, intentional\nbreach of a statute may amount to misfeasance in office if it can be\nestablished that the official concerned deliberately acted unlawfully with\nknowledge that his or her actions would harm the plaintiff:  Odhavji v\nWoodhouse 2003 SCC 69 at para 23; [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 at p. 281. Be that as\nit may\, those elements of the tort are not alleged in the pleading.\n[14]    Apart from these deficiencies\, which could be cured by amendment\, the\ngreater difficulty for the plaintiffs is the defendants__ argument that no\nprivate law duty of care arises in the circumstances alleged. The claim does\nnot appear to fall within any category of cases in which a duty of care has\nbeen previously recognized.\n[15]   \nThe parties agree that the test for determining\nwhether there is a duty of care in a novel situation is that set out by the\nSupreme Court of Canada in Cooper v Hobart\, 2001 SCC 79 [Cooper] adopting\nthe test enunciated by the House of Lords in Anns v Merton London Borough\nCouncil (1977)\, [1978] AC 728 [Anns]. \n[16]   \nCooper concerned\nan action by an investor who claimed that the Registrar of Mortgage Brokers was\nnegligent in failing to properly oversee the conduct of a registered mortgage\nbroker licensed by the regulator. The Supreme Court held that the Registrar did\nnot owe a private law duty of care to the members of the investing public. \n[17]   \nAs described at para 30 of Cooper\, the Anns/Cooper\ntest is composed of two stages:\n[30]    [__] At the first stage of the Anns test\, two questions\narise: (1) was the harm that occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of\nthe defendant__s act? and (2) are there reasons\, notwithstanding the proximity\nbetween the parties that tort liability should not be recognized here? The\nproximity analysis involved at the first stage of the Anns test focuses on\nfactors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.\nThese factors include questions of policy\, in the broad sense of the word. If\nforeseeability and proximity are established at the first stage\, a prima\nfacie duty of care arises. At the second stage of the Ann__s test\, the\nquestion still remains whether there are residual policy considerations outside\nthe relationship of the parties that may negative the imposition of the duty of\ncare. [__]\n[18]   \nThus in applying the two-part test it must be\nfirst determined whether a prima facie duty of care exists. To make that\ndetermination\, the court must consider whether there was reasonable\nforeseeability of the harm\, as well as a relationship of proximity. Proximity\nis generally established by reference to previously recognized or analogous\ncategories of negligence. In a novel case\, the issues of foreseeability and\nproximity must be freshly considered. In my view\, this is a novel case in that\nit concerns a claim that the Crown is liable for making a decision in the\ninterest of maintaining public health. \n[19]   \nIn Cooper\, at paragraph 43\, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada specifically instructed that the factors giving rise to\nproximity\, if they existed\, must arise from the statute under which the\nRegistrar was appointed\, as that statute was the only source of his duties. On\nthe question of proximity\, the Court concluded at paragraph 50: \n[50]    [__] even though the Registrar might reasonably have foreseen\nthat losses to investors [__] would result if he was careless in carrying out\nhis duties under the Act\, there was insufficient proximity between the\nRegistrar and the investors to ground a prima facie duty of care.\n[20]   \nIn this matter\, the Crown concedes\, for the purposes\nof this motion\, that it is reasonably foreseeable that tortious conduct on the\npart of its employees could damage the plaintiffs__ economic interests. However\,\nit denies the existence of any relationship that would establish proximity\nbetween the parties. The duties imposed under the statutes and regulations\ngoverning the actions of Health Canada and its employees\, the defendants argue\,\nare public law duties owed to the public at large\, and not to the private\neconomic interests of the manufacturers or distributors of natural health\nproducts: Department of Health Act\, SC 1996\, c 8 s 4; Food and Drugs\nAct\, RSC\, 1985\, c F-27\, s 30(1); Natural Health Products Regulations\,\nabove\, s 17.\n[21]   \nThis matter is distinguishable from the cases in which\na government agency has been found to be negligent in carrying out inspections.\nSee for example\, Ingles v Tutkaluk Construction Ltd.\, [2000] 1 SCR 298\,\n2000 SCC 12\, where a municipality was determined to be liable for negligent\ninspection of renovation work carried out by a contractor. In this case\,\na policy decision was made to inspect construction even if it had commenced\nprior to the issuance of a building permit.  Once the city chose to\nimplement this decision\, and exercised its power to enter upon the premises to\ninspect the renovations at the appellant__s home\, it owed a duty of care to all\nwho it was reasonable to conclude might be injured by the negligent exercise of\nthat power. That is not analogous to the exercise of a duty to protect consumers\nof a product licensed for sale by the government body\, as in this case.\n[22]   \nThe legislative scheme in the present matter is\nalso distinguishable from that considered by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal\nin Adams v Borrel et al.\, 2008 NBCA 62\, cited by the plaintiffs. In that\ncase\, the federal government had a statutory obligation under the Plant\nProtection Act\, SC 1990\, c 22 s 2 to protect plant life and the\nagricultural sector of the economy by preventing the spread of pests. On that\nbasis\, the Court of Appeal found a prima facie duty of care owed to potato\nfarmers in the province.  Similarly\, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a\nfinding of a prima facie duty of care on the part of Canada in Sauer v\nCanada (Attorney General) et al.\, 2007 ONCA 454 where Canada had publicly\nassumed a duty to ensure the safety of cattle feed. In neither case\, was the\nquestion of Canada__s duty to the broader public at issue. \n[23]   \nIn my view\, the case at bar is analogous to\nthose decisions in which it was found that the Crown owes a duty to the public\nat large but no private law duty to the manufacturers\, distributors or\nretailers of regulated products.\n[24]   \nIn Attis v Canada (Health)\, 2008 ONCA 660\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal of a proposed class proceeding\nwith respect to alleged negligence in relation to the government__s regulation\nof breast implants. The motion judge\, applying the Anns/Cooper analysis\,\nhad found that the claim disclosed no cause of action because the underlying\nlegislative and regulatory scheme did not support the plaintiff__s argument that\nthe Crown owed them a private law duty of care. The Court of Appeal agreed with\nthat conclusion. Referring to the powers and obligations under s 4 of the Department\nof Health Act\, above\, the Court stated at paragraph 54:\n[54]    [__] since Cooper held that a relationship of proximity\nbetween a plaintiff and a government must be found in the governing statute\, I\nbegin with the legislative framework. As I have already noted\, the umbrella\nstatute of the Department of Health Act\, at s. 4\, provides that the Minister__s\nobligations are to the people of Canada for the promotion of their health and\nthe prevention of risk generally. Thus\, under the statute\, the Minister__s duty\nis to the people of Canada as a whole\, not to individual residents.\n[25]   \nA similar conclusion was reached by the British\nColumbia Court of Appeal in Los Angeles Salad Company Inc v Canadian Food\nInspection Agency\, 2013 BCCA 34 (leave to appeal to SCC refused\, 35293\n(August 15\, 2013) [Los Angeles Salad]\, a case that involved allegedly negligent\nacts committed by employees of the Crown engaged in food inspection. As a\nresult of an inspection by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and a\nfinding that carrots imported by the plaintiffs might be infected with\nbacteria\, the carrots were recalled and destroyed. The carrots were\nsubsequently determined to not be infected. The importers sued the Crown\nalleging negligence on the part of the CFIA. In striking the claim\, the motion\njudge concluded that the CFIA owed the carrot importers no duty of care. The\nCourt of Appeal upheld that decision finding\, at paragraph 55:\n[55]    [__] the clear purpose of the relevant legislative\nscheme is to protect the health of Canadians by preventing the sale of\ncontaminated food in Canada. To recognize a private duty of care to food\nsellers would conflict with that purpose. It would put food inspectors in the\nuntenable position of having to balance the paramount interests of the public\nwith private interests of food sellers and would thereby have a chilling effect\non the proper performance of their duties. Thus\, the statutory scheme excludes\nthe possibility of sufficient factual proximity to make it just and reasonable\nto impose a prima facie duty of care in the circumstances of this case\n[__]\n[26]   \nIn this instance\, as in Attis\, the\nstatutory analysis begins with the Department of Health Act. Section 4\nof that statute grants the Minister of Health powers\, duties and functions for\nthe administration of the Acts\, and such orders and regulations of the\nGovernment of Canada assigned to her department for\, among other things\, the\npromotion and preservation of the well-being of the people of Canada\,\nprotection against risks to health and the spreading of diseases\, and\ninvestigation and research into public health. Subsection 30(1) of the Food\nand Drugs Act provides for the making of regulations respecting any food\,\ndrug\, cosmetics or devices. The Natural Health Products Regulations\napply to the sale and distribution of natural health products\, including the\nproduct at issue in these proceedings. \n[27]   \nThe plaintiffs__ argument that the Minister is\nobliged to issue a product license to them under s 7 of the Natural Health\nProducts Regulations upon application ignores the legislative and\nregulatory framework within which that provision operates. In particular\, it\nignores the powers granted the Minister in s 17 of the Regulations to direct a\nlicensee\, manufacturer\, importer and distributor to stop their sale of a\nnatural health product. \n[28]   \nThe clear purpose of the relevant legislative and\nregulatory scheme in this matter is to protect the health of Canadians by\npreventing the sale of contaminated natural health products in Canada. To\nrecognize a private duty of care to the importers and distributors of those\nproducts would conflict with that purpose. I am unable to agree with the\nargument of the plaintiffs that the duty to promote and preserve the health of\nthe people of Canada encompasses a duty to the distributors of products such as\nLibidus. \n[29]   \nI find\, therefore\, that there is no proximity in\nthe relationship of the parties that would make it reasonable to impose a duty\nof care on the defendants to ensure that their examination of the products and\nadministration of the regulatory scheme does not result in economic damage to\nthe plaintiffs. \n[30]   \nIn considering the second stage of the Anns/Cooper\ntest\, the concern\, as stated in Los Angeles Salad\, above\, at paragraph\n63\, is that the duty of care claimed may be so broad that its limits are\nindeterminable and therefore\, as a matter of policy\, imposition of the duty\nshould be negated. The plaintiffs argue that this policy concern is not a\nrelevant consideration in this case as the numbers of those involved in the\nimport\, distribution and sale of the product are limited. While that may be\ntrue in this particular case\, the residual policy concern extends to the precedential\nvalue of the application of a finding of a duty of care to other claims of a\nsimilar nature. \n[31]   \nThe plaintiffs contend that if the claim is\nstruck without leave to amend they will be denied __their right to a day in\ncourt__.  While access to justice is an important value in our society\, it does\nnot mean that every case should be litigated. \n[32]   \nFor the foregoing reasons\, I am satisfied that\nthe claim should be struck in its entirety without leave to amend. \n[33]   \nThe defendants have requested costs and\nsubmitted a Bill of Costs for fees and disbursements totalling $2\,591.82. The\namount of fees claimed is in accordance with the Tariff and the disbursements\nappear to be reasonable. In the circumstances\, however\, I think it appropriate\nto exercise my discretion not to award costs against the plaintiffs. \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nORDER\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n1.     \nThe defendants__ motion is granted;\n2.     \nThe Statement of Claim herein is struck in its\nentirety without leave to amend; and\n3.     \nThe parties shall bear their own costs.\n \n \n""Richard G.

The\nimmigration officer found that Mr. Adewusi suffers from a health condition that\nwould be likely to cause excessive demand on the Canadian health system.\n \n[2]              \nAt\nthe conclusion of the hearing\, I advised the parties that I would be allowing\nthe application. These are my reasons for that decision.\n \nThe Breach of Procedural Fairness \n \n[3]              \nIn\nSapru v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2011 FCA 35\, \,\n413 N.R. 70\,  the Federal Court of Appeal described the respective\nresponsibilities of medical officers and immigration officers when considering\npotential medical admissibility under the Immigration and Refugee Protection\nAct\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27\, and the Immigration and Refugee Protection\nRegulations\, SOR/2002-227.\n \n[4]              \nInsofar\nas the role of medical officers is concerned\, Sapru teaches that medical\nofficers must provide immigration officers with medical opinions regarding any\nhealth condition that an applicant may have\, as well as the likely cost of\ntreating that condition. Where an applicant provides the immigration officer\nwith a plan for managing the condition\, the plan must be examined by the\nmedical officer\, who must then advise the immigration officer with respect to\nmatters such as the feasibility of the plan: Sapru at para. 36. \n \n[5]              \nThe\nrole of the immigration officer is to determine the reasonableness of the\nmedical officer__s opinion: Sapru at para. 37. At the time that an\nimmigration officer makes his or her decision on the admissibility of an\napplicant\, the officer must have sufficient information from the medical\nofficer so as to allow the officer to be satisfied that the medical opinion is\nreasonable: Sapru at para. 43.\n \n[6]              \nThe\nrespondent acknowledges that in this case\, the immigration officer made a final\ndecision in relation to Mr. Adewusi__s medical inadmissibility prior to\nreceiving an opinion from a medical officer addressing the substantial medical\nevidence and submissions filed by Mr. Adewusi in response to a fairness letter.\n \n[7]              \nThis\nwas a clear breach of the process mandated by Sapru. The immigration\nofficer is not a medical expert. When the immigration officer made a final\ndecision with respect to Mr. Adewusi__s application without the benefit of a\nproper assessment of his supplementary submissions by a qualified medical\nofficer\, the immigration officer denied Mr. Adewusi the type of individualized\nmedical assessment mandated by Sapru and by decisions such as Hilewitz\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 SCC 57\, [2005] 2\nS.C.R. 706.  \n \nThe Appropriate Remedy\n \n[8]              \nAs a\ngeneral rule\, a breach of procedural fairness will void the hearing and the\nresulting decision: see Cardinal v. Kent Institution\, [1985] 2 S.C.R.\n643\, [1985] S.C.J. No. 78 (QL). The Supreme Court of Canada observed in Cardinal\nthat the right to a fair hearing is __an independent\, unqualified right\nwhich finds its essential justification in the sense of procedural justice\nwhich any person affected by an administrative decision is entitled to have__:\nat para. 23. The Court went on in the same paragraph to observe that __[i]t is\nnot for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of\nspeculation as to what the result might have been had there been a [fair]\nhearing__.\n \n[9]              \nThere\nis a limited exception to this rule. That is\, a reviewing court may disregard a\nbreach of procedural fairness __where the demerits of the claim are such that it\nwould in any case be hopeless__: Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. et al. v.\nCanada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board\, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202\, [1994]\nS.C.J. No. 14 (QL) at para. 53. See also Yassine v. Canada (Minister of Employment\nand Immigration)\n(1994)\, 172 N.R. 308 at para. 9 (F.C.A.). This situation may arise where\, for\nexample\, the circumstances of the case involve a legal question which has an\ninevitable answer: Mobil Oil at para. 52.\n \n[10]          \nThe respondent\nargues that nothing would be served by quashing the immigration officer__s\ninadmissibility decision and remitting the matter for re-determination. \nAccording to the respondent\, the outcome of Mr. Adewusi__s application for\npermanent residence will inevitably be the same.\n \n[11]          \nIn\nsupport of this argument\, the respondent relies on affidavits filed by the\nimmigration and medical officers involved in assessing Mr. Adewusi__s\napplication.  \n \n[12]          \nThe\nmedical officer__s affidavit reviews the supplementary submissions filed by Mr.\nAdewusi in response to a fairness letter. The officer states that this\nadditional information did not change his original conclusion that Mr. Adewusi\nsuffers from a serious health condition that would be likely to cause\nsignificant demand on the Canadian health system.\n \n[13]          \nThe\nimmigration officer__s affidavit refers to the opinion that was provided by the\nmedical officer shortly after the immigration officer made his decision\nrefusing Mr. Adewusi__s application for permanent residence. The immigration\nofficer says that had he reviewed that opinion prior to making the decision\nunder review\, he still would have found Mr. Adewusi to be medically\ninadmissible.\n \n[14]          \nAs\na general rule\, applications for judicial review are to be conducted on the\nbasis of the record that was before the original decision-maker. Additional\nevidence may be admissible on an application for judicial review where\, as\nhere\, an issue arises with respect to the fairness of the process that was\nfollowed in arriving at the decision under review.\n \n[15]          \nHowever\,\nthis is a narrow exception. It does not allow a party to adduce affidavit\nevidence on an application for judicial review in an effort to bolster its\nposition by attempting to cure a defect in the decision-making process.\n \n[16]          \nThe\nimmigration officer__s affidavit is proper to the extent that it acknowledges\nthe procedural error that was made in this case and attempts to explain how it\noccurred. However\, I am not prepared to accord any weight to the portions of\nthe affidavit in which the immigration officer speculates as to how he would\nhave decided Mr. Adewusi__s application for permanent residence had he had the\nproper medical information before him.\n \n[17]          \nInsofar\nas the medical opinion contained in the affidavit of the medical officer is\nconcerned\, it is not for this Court to decide whether the medical officer__s\nopinion is reasonable. That is the responsibility of an immigration officer in\ncarrying out an admissibility determination.\n \n[18]          \nMoreover\,\nthe medical officer__s affidavit provides reasons for confirming his original\nassessment of Mr. Adewusi__s medical admissibility which do not appear in the\nassessment completed by the medical officer shortly after the immigration\nofficer__s decision to refuse Mr. Adewusi__s application for permanent residence.\nNo weight\nshould be given to this affidavit to the extent that it seeks to provide additional\nreasons for affirming the medical officer__s original assessment of Mr. Adewusi__s\nmedical condition.\n \n[19]          \nThe\nsubmissions provided by Mr. Adewusi in response to the fairness letter raise a\nquestion as to the accuracy of the medical officer__s diagnosis and prognosis.\nIn addition to providing several additional medical reports that were not\nbefore the medical officer when he made his original assessment\, Mr. Adewusi\nalso highlighted the diverging diagnoses that he had received from his doctors\,\nhis continuing lack of symptoms\, and the fact that his condition had not\ndeteriorated over time. These factors potentially call into question the\naccuracy of the medical officer__s original diagnosis. \n \n[20]          \nAs\na result\, I cannot say at this point that Mr. Adewusi__s application for\npermanent residency is doomed to failure. The immigration officer__s decision\nwill therefore be set aside\, and the matter will be remitted to a different\nimmigration officer and a different medical officer for re-determination.\n \nCosts \n \n[21]          \nCounsel for Mr. Adewusi submits that the breach\nof procedural fairness in this case was so self-evident that an order of costs\nshould be made in his favour. He further submits that the explanation provided\nin immigration officer__s affidavit for the error that occurred in this case is\nmisleading\, and is not credible in light of documents appearing in the tribunal\nrecord.\n \n[22]          \nCosts\nare not ordinarily awarded in immigration proceedings in this Court. Rule 22 of\nthe Federal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules\,\nSOR/93-22 provides that __No costs shall be awarded to or payable by any\nparty in respect of an application for leave\, an application for judicial review\nor an appeal under these Rules unless the Court\, for special reasons\, so\norders__.\n \n[23]          \nThe\nthreshold for establishing the existence of __special reasons__ is high\, and each\ncase will turn on its own particular circumstances: Ibrahim v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\,\n2007 FC 1342\, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1734 (QL) at para. 8.\n \n[24]          \nThis\nCourt has found special reasons to exist where one party has acted in a manner\nthat may be characterized as unfair\, oppressive\, improper or actuated by bad\nfaith: see Manivannan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 1392\, [2008] F.C.J. No. 1754 (QL) at para. 51. \n \n[25]          \n__Special\nreasons__ have also been found to exist where there is conduct that\nunnecessarily or unreasonably prolongs the proceedings: see\, for example\, John\nDoe v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 535\,\n[2006] F.C.J. No. 674 (QL); Johnson v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, 2005 FC 1262\, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1523 (QL) at para. 26; and Qin\nv. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2002 FCT 1154\, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1576 (QL). In\nmy view\, this is not such a case. \n \n[26]          \nThe\nfact that an immigration application for judicial review is opposed and the\ntribunal is subsequently found to have erred does not\, by itself\, give rise to\na __special reason__ justifying an award of costs. I am not satisfied that the decision\nof the respondent to defend this application was so unreasonable as to entitle Mr. Adewusi\nto an award of costs.\n \n[27]          \nI\nam also not prepared to make a finding of misconduct on the part of the\nimmigration officer on the strength of the record before me. An allegation that\na government official has provided misleading information under oath in a\njudicial proceeding is a very serious allegation\, and a person accused of such\nmisconduct must have a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations against\nhim or her.\n \n[28]          \nWhile\nMr. Adewusi has raised questions with respect to the immigration officer__s\nexplanation for the error that occurred in the processing of this case\, he\nchose not to cross-examine the officer on his affidavit. As a result\, Mr.\nAdewusi__s concerns were never put to the officer\, and the officer has never\nbeen afforded an opportunity to address them. \n \n[29]          \nI\nam therefore not persuaded that this is an appropriate case for costs.\n \nConclusion \n \n[30]          \nFor\nthese reasons\, I have concluded that the application for judicial review should\nbe allowed.\n \nCertification \n \n[31]          \nNeither\nparty has suggested a question for certification\, and none arises here. \n \n\n\nJUDGMENT\n \n            THIS\nCOURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that:\n \n            1.         This\napplication for judicial review is allowed and Mr. Adewusi__s application for permanent\nresidence is remitted to a\ndifferent\nimmigration officer and a different medical officer for re-determination; and\n \n            2.\n        No serious question of general importance is certified.\n \n__Anne Mactavish__\n\nJudge\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL COURT\n \nSOLICITORS OF RECORD\n \n \nDOCKET:                                          IMM-4013-11\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                          ISMAILA\nADEBAYO ADEWUSI v.\n                                                            THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND\nIMMIGRATION\n \n \nPLACE OF HEARING:                    Toronto\, Ontario\n \nDATE OF HEARING:                      January 17\, 2012\n \nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nAND JUDGMENT:                          MACTAVISH\nJ.\n \nDATED:                                             January 19\, 2012\n \n \n \nAPPEARANCES:\n \n\n\n\nMario D.

JUSTICE BLAIS\n \nBETWEEN:\nROWLAND GEORGE DANIEL COHEN\nApplicant\n \nand\n \nTHE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nRespondent\n \n \nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT AND JUDGMENT\n \n[1]                 This is an application for judicial review of the decision of a visa officer (the officer) dated September 22\, 2005\, which refused Mr. Rowan George Daniel Cohen's (the applicant) application for permanent residence. The refusal was based on the conclusion that the applicant was inadmissible to Canada pursuant to subsection 38(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 (the Act) because his wife might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services as a result of her diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n \nFACTS\n[2]                 The applicant is a citizen of the United Kingdom (U.K.) who is married with three children. The applicant had an offer of employment in British Columbia as a plumber/gas fitter. He applied for permanent residency and was assessed as having sufficient points to qualify as a skilled worker.\n \n[3]                 By letter dated September 16\, 2004 (fairness letter)\, the officer advised the applicant that he may not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada as a result of his wife's medical condition. The officer invited the applicant to submit additional information relating to the medical condition before the officer made a final decision with respect to the application for permanent residency. The applicant complied with the officer's request for more information.\n \nDECISION OF THE OFFICER\n[4]                 Despite qualifying as a skilled worker\, the visa officer refused the applicant's application for permanent residence because she determined\, pursuant to subsection 38(1) of the Act\, that his spouse is a person whose health condition\, Rheumatoid Arthritis\, might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services in Canada.\n \nISSUE\n[5]                 Did the visa officer err in her analysis of ""excessive demand""?\n \n \nANALYSIS\n[6]                 The pertinent legislative provisions of the Act regarding the present matter are as follows:\n\n\n\n 42. A foreign national\, other than a protected person\, is inadmissible on grounds of an inadmissible family member if\n \n(a) their accompanying family member or\, in prescribed circumstances\, their non-accompanying family member is inadmissible; or\n(b) they are an accompanying family member of an inadmissible person.\n \n\n 42. Emportent\, sauf pour le r_sident permanent ou une personne prot_g_e\, interdiction de territoire pour inadmissibilit_ familiale les faits suivants :\na) l'interdiction de territoire frappant tout membre de sa famille qui l'accompagne ou qui\, dans les cas r_glementaires\, ne l'accompagne pas;\nb) accompagner\, pour un membre de sa famille\, un interdit de territoire.\n \n\n\n\n 38. (1) A foreign national is inadmissible on health grounds if their health condition\n(a) is likely to be a danger to public health;\n(b) is likely to be a danger to public safety; or\n(c) might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services.\n \n\n 38. (1) Emporte\, sauf pour le r_sident permanent\, interdiction de territoire pour motifs sanitaires l'_tat de sant_ de l'_tranger constituant vraisemblablement un danger pour la sant_ ou la s_curit_ publiques ou risquant d'entra_ner un fardeau excessif pour les services sociaux ou de sant_.\n \n\n\n\n\n[7]                 The pertinent provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations) are as follows:\n\n\n\n 20. An officer shall determine that a foreign national is inadmissible on health grounds if an assessment of their health condition has been made by an officer who is responsible for the application of sections 29 to 34 and the officer concluded that the foreign national's health condition is likely to be a danger to public health or public safety or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand.\n \n34. Before concluding whether a foreign national's health condition might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand\, an officer who is assessing the foreign national's health condition shall consider\n(a) any reports made by a health practitioner or medical laboratory with respect to the foreign national; and\n(b) any condition identified by the medical examination.\n \n1(1) ""excessive demand"" means\n(a) a demand on health services or social services for which the anticipated costs would likely exceed average Canadian per capita health services and social services costs over a period of five consecutive years immediately following the most recent medical examination required by these Regulations\, unless there is evidence that significant costs are likely to be incurred beyond that period\, in which case the period is no more than 10 consecutive years; or\n(b) a demand on health services or social services that would add to existing waiting lists and would increase the rate of mortality and morbidity in Canada as a result of the denial or delay in the provision of those services to Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

(excessive demand)\n \n\n\n\n\n \n[8]                 In Hilewitz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)[2005] S.C.J. No. 58\, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that the standard of review is correctness when assessing whether or not an officer erred in determining that an applicant might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on the health or social services pursuant to subparagraph 19(1)a)(ii) (now subsection 38(1)) of the Act.\n \n \nDid the visa officer err in her analysis of ""excessive demand""?\n \n[9]                 The applicant argues that the visa officer's and the medical officer's analysis of excessive demand is flawed because both failed in their obligation to calculate the health services costs and social services costs over a period of five years for the average Canadian and the applicant's spouse.\n \n[10]              The applicant submits that the officer's decision to deny permanent residency is based on the perception that the applicant's spouse needs the expensive drug Entanercept to control her medical condition. However\, as mentioned by the applicant\, if the officer had considered the applicant's submissions in response to the fairness letter\, she would have concluded that the applicant's spouse does not need Entanercept to control her condition. As such\, the applicant contends that his spouse would not place an excessive demand on the health care system.\n \n[11]             I have reviewed carefully the documents provided as evidence\, particularly the handwritten notes of the medical officer\, Dr. Georges Giovinazzo\, his affidavit and the transcript of the cross-examination. I have also reviewed the transcript of the visa officer\, Ms. Anne Vanden Bosch\, her cross-examination and her affidavit. I also reviewed the medical file.\n \n[12]             I am particularly concerned with some discrepancies in the medical officer's calculation of costs. There exists a threshold of anticipated annual need for health and social services for the average Canadian created by the regulation with reference to the amount established by the Canadian Information on Health Centre. At the time of the applicant's assessment\, the threshold amount was evaluated at $3950 per year.\n \n[13]             The medical officer identified that the health costs for Entanercept in the U.K. - the drug the applicant's wife was taking - was over $17\,000 per year. In his assessment of how much the aforementioned drug would cost in British Columbia\, the medical officer took\, into account certain reductions that apply in that province and arrived at the figure of roughly $10\,000 per year.\n \n[14]             Later in his cross-examination\, the medical officer responded that the applicant's wife could need Entanercept for a year and a half before she could rely solely on a new alternative therapy called ""Margaret Hills"". As such\, the cost of the drug would be estimated at $15\,000 for the year and a half time period. Presumably after that time period there would no longer be any need for the expensive drug. As such\, in calculating the excessive demand over a five year period\, as required by the Act\, the total cost would be less than the threshold amount for the average Canadian mentioned above.\n \n[15]             When we read the notes\, the affidavit and the transcript as a whole\, we see that the medical officer is sceptical regarding the success of the ""Margaret Hills"" therapy and believes that\, if the therapy fails\, the applicant will once again be relying on the expensive medication that was successful in controlling her condition in the past.\n \n[16]             Nevertheless\, there are too many speculations surrounding the file and both the visa officer and the medical officer were not precise enough in their conclusions.\n \n[17]             In my view\, it amounts to a reviewable error that justifies this Court's intervention.\n \n[18]             Both parties suggested questions for certification:\n\n Should the calculation of ""excessive demand"" in rule 1(1) of the Regulations include costs of health and social services or health or social services?  \n \n\n In calculating the threshold to determine whether an applicant will cause an excessive demand on health services or social services\, should that threshold include both health services and social services costs for the average Canadian in every case?  \n \n[19]             In my view\, the conclusions in this case are based on imprecise assessment by both the visa and the medical officers. When the assessment is made pursuant to the existing law and regulation with the reference to the proper numbers establish by the Canadian Health Information Center\, the existing regulation scheme responds to the suggested questions.\n \n[20]             Those questions do not raise a matter of general importance\, therefore\, they will not be certified.\n \n \n \nJUDGMENT\n \n1.        This application for judicial review is granted.\n2.        The case is returned to another visa officer and another medical officer to be redetermined.\n3.

The Applicant applied under\nthe __entrepreneur__ category prior to June 2002\, and\, although he was found to\nqualify\, he was found to be inadmissible\, pursuant to s.38(1) of the Immigration\nand Refugee Protection Act (IRPA); on the basis of medical evidence\,\nthe Officer found that the Applicant__s health conditions\, which included polycystic\nkidney disease\, hypertension\, moderate mitral regurgitation and chronic renal\nfailure\, would reasonably be expected to cause __excessive demands__ on Canada__s\nhealth services.\n \n[2]              \nThe\nApplicant argues that\, as he is an entrepreneur with considerable net worth\, the\nOfficer erred in law by failing to consider his ability to provide for his own\nhealth care if admitted to Canada\, and\, further\, that the\nOfficer breached procedural fairness by not considering his request for a\ntemporary resident permit.\n \nI.          Did\nthe Officer err in law by not considering the Applicant__s financial ability to\npay for his own health care?\n \nA.  Considerations\nin answering the question\n \n[3]              \nOn this\nissue\, the Respondent argues that the Applicant__s ability to pay was properly\nnot considered because it is not a factor that the Officer could\, as a matter\nof law\, take into consideration.  Five reasons are provided in support of this\nsubmission.  As outlined in the analysis which follows\, I agree with the\nRespondent on each reason advanced.\n \n1. \nThere is a distinction between social and health services\n \n[4]              \nThe\nApplicant relies on the Supreme Court of Canada__s decision in Hilewitz v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration); De Jong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2005] S.C.J. No. 58 (Hilewitz)\nto argue that\, as is the case with social services\, a person in the Applicant__s\nposition can pay for his own medical health services. \n \n[5]              \nIn\nHilewitz the\nCourt reviewed decisions to deny permanent resident visas to two families with\ndisabled children because\, pursuant to s.19(1)(a)(ii) of IRPA\, the\ndisabled children might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on\nsocial services in Canada.  In the majority\ndecision\, the Court found that the family__s ability to pay was a relevant\nfactor when assessing for permanent resident status.  The Court found that the\n__investor__ and __self-employed__ categories under which the applicants qualified\nfor admission\, to a large extent\, concerned the individual__s assets\, and\, thus\,\nit would seem incongruous to interpret the legislation in such a way that the\nvery assets that qualify these individuals for admission to Canada could be ignored in\ndetermining admissibility of their disabled child.\n \n[6]              \nIn Hilewitz at para. 62\, the Court\nnoted that the officials concerned should have accounted for the means that the\nfamilies had in providing social services for their disabled children through\nprivately funded mechanisms:\n_ 62     \nThe medical notifications relating to both Gavin Hilewitz and Dirkje de Jong\nidentified three social services that might be required: special education\,\nvocational training and respite care. The Hilewitz and de Jong families both\nexpressed an intention to send their children to private schools with\nspecialized education. Mr. Hilewitz also expressed an intention to purchase a\ncompany which would provide employment for Gavin\, thus avoiding the need for\nvocational training. Nevertheless\, both applications were rejected on the basis\nthat there would be excessive demands on social services.\n \n[Emphasis\nadded]\n \nFurther\, at\nparas. 67-69\, the Court recognized the difference between social and health\nservices and noted that in Ontario\, there were mechanisms by which parents\, with the ability to pay\, might be required to contribute\nfinancially to the costs of social services for their children:\n_ 67     \nIn the de Jong case\, the letter from Dr. Bertrand similarly shows that he\ntoo made no distinction between health and social services\, and\nrefused to take into account the de Jong family's resources and support in\ndetermining the potential burden on social services. Instead\, he raised the\nspeculative possibility that the family would fall on hard times and be forced\nto resort to publicly funded services. Despite the clear directions in the\norder of Reed J.\, Dr. Bertrand persisted in insisting that in making his\ndetermination\, he had no authority in law to consider the family's financial\nresources.\n \n_ 68     \nThese views\, it seems to me\, undermine and contradict the direction in the\nlegislation that a person can only be found to be ineligible for admission if\nhis or her admission ""would"" or ""might reasonably be\nexpected"" to cause excessive demands. That means that something more than\nspeculation must be applied to the inquiry. The fears articulated in the\nrejections of the Hilewitz and de Jong applications\, such as possible\nbankruptcy\, mobility\, school closure or parental death\, represent contingencies\nthat could be raised in relation to any applicant. Using such contingencies to\nnegate a family's genuine ability and willingness to absorb some of the burdens\ncreated by a child's disabilities anchors an applicant's admissibility to\nconjecture\, not reality. \n \n_ 69     \nSocial services are regulated by provincial statutes. In Ontario\, the province\nin which both the Hilewitz and de Jong families have expressed their intention\nto live\, the Developmental Services Act\, R.S.O. 1990\, c. D.11\, as\namended\, addresses some of the facilities\, assistance and services that may be\nprovided to a person with developmental disabilities. Section 15 of the Developmental\nServices Act Regulations\, R.R.O. 1990\, Reg. 272\, states that a\ndetermination will be made as to the ability of the applicant for\n""admission to a facility and for assistance"" to contribute ""to\nall or any part of the cost"" thereof. Section 16 extends the same approach\nto applications for ""services"". The Ontario\nlegislation manifestly contemplates the possibility of financial contributions\nfrom families able to make them. Even if the Hilewitz and de Jong families'\nstated intentions regarding education and training did not materialize\, the\nfinancial resources of both families are such that they likely would be\nrequired to contribute a substantial portion\, if not the entirety\, of the costs\nassociated with certain social services provided by the province.\n \n[Emphasis added]\n \nAs a result\, because\nHilewitz dealt specifically with an Applicant__s ability to pay for social\nservices and not health services\, I reject the Applicant__s argument\nthat the reasoning in Hilewitz applies equally to health services. \n \n2. \nA permanent resident automatically has health insurance in Canada\n \n[7]              \nThe Canada Health Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. C-6\n(CHA) provides that the health services that may be\nrequired by the Applicant are insured services covered by provincial and\nterritorial publicly funded health care insurance plans: s.2\nprovides that __insured health services__ includes medically necessary hospital\nand physician services provided to insured residents of a province\, and an insured\nperson includes a resident of the province for a set period; s.9 requires that\nhealth services provided be comprehensive; and s.10 provides that __the health\ncare insurance plan of a province must entitle one hundred per cent of the\ninsured residents of a province to the insured health services provided for by\nthe plan on uniform terms and conditions.__\n \n3. \nPaying for health care is contrary to Canadian public policy\n \n[8]              \nSection 3 of the CHA provides the\nprimary objective of Canadian health care policy:\n\n\n\n\n3. It is hereby declared that\n  the primary objective of Canadian health care policy is to protect\, promote\n  and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate\n  reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers.\n[Emphasis added]\n\n\n3. La politique canadienne de la sant_ a pour premier objectif de\n  prot_ger\, de favoriser et d__am_liorer le bien-_tre physique et mental des\n  habitants du Canada et de faciliter un acc_s satisfaisant aux services de\n  sant_\, sans obstacles d__ordre financier ou autre.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n[9]              \nCounsel for the Applicant confirmed that\, if allowed to stay in\nCanada\, the Applicant will likely reside in Ontario\, and\, therefore\, Ontario\nlaw comes into play in the present Application.  In Ontario\, s.10 of the Health\nInsurance Act\,\nR.S.O. 1990\, c.6 states that the purpose of the Ontario Health Care\nInsurance Plan (Plan) is to provide for insurance against the costs of insured\nservices on a non-profit basis\, and on uniform terms and conditions available to all\nresidents of Ontario.  This legislation establishes that every person who is an\neligible resident of Ontario is entitled to become an insured person under the\nPlan\, to have the insured health services they require paid for by the Plan\,\nand also prohibits all other contracts of insurance for insured health\nservices.\n \n4.  There is no private health care\nin Canada\n \n[10]          \nRelevant\nto the present Application\, the Federal Court of Appeal in Deol v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n[2002]\nF.C.J. No. 949 at para. 46 addressed whether an Applicant__s ability to pay for\nhealth services should be considered when issuing permanent resident visas:\nIssue 5: Did the Board\nerr in law in failing to have regard to the financial ability of the applicant\nor members of her family to pay for the cost of surgery that might be\nrecommended for Mr. Singh?\n \n_ 46     \nIn my opinion\, it did not. As has been held in several previous cases\, it is\nnot possible to enforce a personal undertaking to pay for health services that\nmay be required after a person has been admitted to Canada as a permanent\nresident\, if the services are available without payment. The Minister\nhas no power to admit a person as a permanent resident on the condition that\nthe person either does not make a claim on the health insurance plans in the\nprovinces\, or promises to reimburse the costs of any services required. See\,\nfor example\, Choi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1995)\, 98\nF.T.R. 308 at para. 30; Cabaldon v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998)\, 140\nF.T.R. 296 at para. 8; Poon\, supra\, at paras. 18-19. \n \n[Emphasis added]\n \nThe basis for\nthe decision is that\, on the application of the CHA\, there should be no\nprivate market outlets for health services in Canada.  \n \n[11]          \nBy s.12 and ss.18-19 of the CHA\, financial\ncharges such as extra billing and user charges for insured health services are\nnot permitted as they are seen to be barriers\, or impediments\, to people\nseeking medical care and\, as such\, are contrary to the accessibility criterion.\nThus\, charging patients for insured health services is expressly prohibited\nunder the CHA.  Based upon how Canada disseminates health services to\npermanent residents\, a person__s financial ability to pay for health services\nwould be irrelevant.\n \n[12]          \n  Section 10 of the Commitment to the\nFuture of Medicare Act\, R.S.O.\n2004\, c. 5 prohibits physicians from receiving payment or benefit for insured\nhealth services covered by the Plan from anyone other than the Plan\, a\npublic hospital or a prescribed facility.  Section 10 also prohibits physicians\nfrom charging more or accepting payment or another benefit for more than the\namount payable under the Plan for rendering insured services to an insured\nperson.  As well\, a person or entity generally may not charge or accept payment\nor other benefit for an insured service rendered to an insured person.\n \n5.  Excessive demands on health care are more than just financial\ndemands\n \n[13]          \nAn applicant with abundant resources would still pose __excessive\ndemands__ on Canadian health care by simply using up finite places in waiting\nlists.  Justice Snyder explains this point in Gilani v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2003] F.C.J. No. 240 at paras. 23-26:\n_ 23     \nThe high cost of hospitalisation and treatment was one of the reasons for the\nProgram Manager's refusal to issue the Minister's Permit.  However\,\nif the Applicant were granted a Minister's Permit\, she would not be eligible\nfor provincial health insurance in Ontario (""OHIP"").  As a\nresult\, the high cost of her treatment was not something that would place an\nexcessive demand on the Canadian health care system; it would be the Applicant\,\nand not OHIP\, who would pay for that treatment.  Furthermore\, the\nevidence revealed that the Applicant had private medical insurance to cover her\ntreatment expenses and had significant financial assets (she was prepared to\ninvest approximately $2 million Canadian in her sister's business) which could\npay for anything not covered by insurance.  Her admission on a Minister's\nPermit\, therefore\, would not actually cost the province anything in terms of\nher medical treatment. \n \n_ 24     \nAlthough the Program Manager was in favour of obtaining the province's input on\nthe admission of the Applicant on a Minister's Permit\, there is no indication\nthat the input was actually obtained.  If the Program Manager had\ncontacted the province\, she would have discovered that the Applicant would not\nqualify for OHIP if admitted on a Minister's Permit.  In my view\, the\nApplicant's eligibility for provincial health insurance is something that the\nProgram Manager should have investigated and referred to specifically in her\ndecision given her concern regarding the high cost of the Applicant's\ntreatment.  As a result\, her conclusion regarding the cost of the\nApplicant's medical treatment and its relation to the issuance of a Minister's\nPermit was unreasonable and based on inaccurate assumptions. \n \n_ 25     \nHowever\, in my view\, this error is not sufficient to allow this application\nfor judicial review.  The high cost of treatment\, although a major\nfactor in the Program Manager's decision\, was only one factor considered by her\nin refusing to issue a Minister's Permit.  That decision was also\nbased on the potential displacement of Canadians from waiting lists and the\nlack of a compelling need to enter Canada.  While\nthe medical evidence indicates that her breast cancer has stabilized\, it also\nindicates that she will require care from a cancer specialist and will probably\nrequire treatment in the future.  Although\, she is willing and\nable to pay the costs of any medical treatment she does require\, it is likely\nthat providing service to her would displace Canadians waiting for medical\nservices. \n \n_ 26     \nWith respect to the issue of the displacement of Canadians on waiting lists\,\nthere is no mention in the Certified Tribunal Records of the Applicant's\nintention to seek treatment in the United States.  If the Applicant\ndid intend to seek medical treatment in the United States\, this information\nshould have been submitted.  The decision of the Program Manager\,\nbased on the remaining evidence\, is supported by reasons that can stand up to a\nsomewhat probing examination \n \n[Emphasis added]\n \nB.  Conclusion\n \n[14]          \nGiven the considerations described\, I find that financial ability\ndoes not change entitlement or access to available health care\, and this\, compounded\nwith the reality that there is no private health care available\, results in the\nconclusion that the Applicant__s financial ability to pay for health care is not\na salient consideration in granting permanent resident status.  \n \n[15]          \nAs a result\, I find that the Officer did not err in law by not considering the\nApplicant__s financial ability to pay for his own health care. \n \nII.        Did the Officer breach\nprocedural fairness by not considering the Applicant__s request for a Temporary\nResident Permit?\n \n[16]          \nSection 24(1) of IRPA\nenunciates how a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) is issued:\n\n\n\n\n24. (1) A foreign national\n  who\, in the opinion of an officer\, is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements\n  of this Act becomes a temporary resident if an officer is of the opinion that\n  it is justified in the circumstances and issues a temporary resident permit\,\n  which may be cancelled at any time.\n \n\n\n \n24. (1) Devient\n  r_sident temporaire l___tranger\, dont l__agent estime qu__il est interdit de\n  territoire ou ne se conforme pas _ la pr_sente loi\, _ qui il d_livre\, s__il\n  estime que les circonstances le justifient\, un permis de s_jour temporaire __\n  titre r_vocable en tout temps.\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWhere an applicant requests that he or\nshe be considered for a TRP\, the request must be accommodated (Japson v. Canada\, [2004] F.C.J. No. 694 at\npara. 25).\n \n[17]          \nIn a\nletter to the Canadian Consulate General dated February 3\, 2004\, the Applicant\nmade the following statement:\nIf necessary\, our client__s\nwould not be adverse to coming to Canada\non Temporary Resident permits\, with such terms and conditions which you may\nrequire.\n \n(Applicant__s Record\, p. 186)\n \nI find that the statement constitutes a\nrequest for consideration of a TRP.\n \n[18]          \nThe\nRespondent defends the Officer__s failure to consider the Applicant__s request on\nthe basis that the Applicant did not provide sufficient information and\nargument to enable the Officer to determine whether a TRP is warranted.  I\nreject this argument.  I agree with Counsel for the Applicant that the request placed before the Officer\, when read\nin context with the application for permanent residence\, made it clear that the\nApplicant wished to remain in Canada by whatever grant of\nauthority.  Therefore\, the Applicant__s request to the Officer\, to consider\ngranting him a TRP\, required the Officer to respond without the necessity of a\nseparate submission.  In my opinion\, the\nfailure of the Officer to deal with the request constitutes an error in due\nprocess.  \n\n\nORDER\n \nPursuant to s.18.1(3)(a) of\nthe Federal Courts Act\, I hereby order that a different immigration\nofficer assess the Applicant__s Temporary Resident Permit Application on the\nbasis of the existing evidentiary record. \n \n__Douglas\nR.

One of these was the\nhardship that she would face if returned to St. Vincent because of her\npsychological state. Ms. Davis also asserted that her psychological problems\nwould be exacerbated if she were separated from her father in Canada\, and that\nshe would be unable to access proper care for her mental health issues in St.\n Vincent.\n[2]              \nMs. Davis__ application was rejected by a PRRA Officer\, who found that\nshe had not established that she would face unusual\, undeserved or\ndisproportionate hardship if she were required to return to St. Vincent in\norder to apply for permanent residence.\n \n[3]              \nFor the reasons that follow\, I am of the view that this decision was\nunreasonable.  Consequently\, the application for judicial review will be\ngranted.\n \nAnalysis\n \n[4]              \nMs. Davis is a failed refugee claimant. Although aspects of her refugee\nclaim were found not to be credible\, the Refugee Protection Division did not\nappear to take issue with her claim that she had suffered significant physical\nand sexual abuse as a young child. In support of her PRRA application\, Ms.\nDavis provided the Officer with psychological evidence documenting the negative\nimpact of this abuse on her mental health.\n \n[5]              \nThis is the second time that Ms. Davis__ H&C application has been\nbefore this Court. The first decision made with respect to her application was\nset aside: see Davis v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, 2009 FC 1223\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1510. Justice Boivin\nfound that Ms. Davis had been denied procedural fairness when the PRRA Officer\nrelied upon a document from the World Health Organization dealing with the\navailability of mental health care in St. Vincent\, without first disclosing the\ndocument to her.\n \n[6]              \nAccording to Justice Boivin\, the WHO document was not commonly referred\nto\, and was __more technical__ than human rights reports. As a consequence\, he\nwas of the view that Ms. Davis should have been afforded the opportunity to\nrespond to the document. Justice Boivin also found that the Officer erred in\nfinding that the WHO document supported the proposition that there is adequate\nlevel of mental health in St. Vincent. He observed that the data contained in\nthe WHO document showed that the mental health resources available to citizens\nin St. Vincent __can be below average__: at para. 25.\n \n[7]              \nAfter Justice Boivin__s decision\, Ms. Davis__ H&C application was\nreferred to a different PRRA Officer for reassessment. This Officer provided\nMs. Davis with a copy of the WHO document\, and afforded her an opportunity to\nrespond to it. \n \n[8]              \nThe second PRRA Officer came to the same conclusion as the first with\nrespect to the availability of mental health care in St. Vincent. In coming to\nthis conclusion\, the second Officer did not\, however\, simply rely on the World\nHealth Organization study that had been disclosed to Ms. Davis. The Officer\nalso chose to rely on a second study __ this one from the Pan American Health\nOrganization. This document was similar in type to the WHO study\, but contained\nmore comprehensive information with respect to the availability of mental\nhealth care in St. Vincent. It was never disclosed to Ms. Davis.\n \n[9]              \nIn other words\, the second Officer committed precisely the same error as\nthe first Officer.\n \n[10]          \nThe second error committed by the PRRA Officer relates to the treatment\nof the evidence contained in the Pan American Health Organization document. Based\nupon this document\, the Officer concluded that __Mental health services are\nbeing integrated in primary care\, and ten acute care beds are available the\nmain referral centre for treatment of the acutely ill psychiatric patient__.  \n \n[11]          \nHowever\, Ms. Davis had put more recent evidence before the Officer\nemanating directly from the Ministry of Health in St. Vincent which led to a\nvery different conclusion. This document stated that the __Integration of mental\nhealth services into primary care is very limited due to inadequate psychiatric\nsurveillance and support services such as social workers\, counselors\, and\noccupational therapists__. \n \n[12]          \nThe Ministry of Health document went on to observe that there was __no\nstructured rehabilitation programme offered at any government health\ninstitution__. The document also referred to the availability of mental health\nsupport from non-governmental organizations\, but noted that __these programmes\nare insufficient to offset the many social problems challenging the society.__\n \n[13]          \nWhere a decision-maker refers to evidence supporting its finding in some\ndetail\, but does not mention evidence leading to the opposite conclusion\, the\nCourt may infer that the decision-maker overlooked the contradictory evidence\nwhen making its finding of fact: Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425\, 157\nF.T.R. 35 at paras.14-17.\n \n[14]          \nIt was an error for the Officer not to address the Ministry of Health\ninformation\, given that this seemingly reliable evidence directly contradicted\na central finding upon which the decision was based.\n[15]          \nThe Officer also erred in assessing the hardship that Ms. Davis would\nsuffer as a result of being separated from her family in Canada.  The Officer\nnoted Ms. Davis__ father__s statement that her well-being was __extremely\ndependant on our presence in her life and the ability to remain here in Canada\,\na place of safety__. After referring to Ms. Davis__ relationship with her\nsiblings\, the Officer then went on to state that __the evidence before me does\nnot establish that severing these ties would have a significant negative impact\non her that would constitute an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate\nhardship__.\n \n[16]          \nThis finding is problematic\, as it flies in this face of the\npsychological evidence that was before the Officer. This evidence indicated\nthat Ms. Davis and her father had a __close-knit\, strong attachment__ and that\nshe was __highly dependant upon this man__s presence in her life__. In the opinion\nof the psychologist\, __breaking such strong bonds would likely be emotionally\ndevastating for her__. Indeed\, it was the psychologist__s professional opinion\nthat Ms. Davis __would be at very high risk of suicide__ if she were required to\nleave Canada and the support of her family members behind. \n \n[17]          \nIn light of this evidence it is difficult to discern from the Officer__s\nreasons how the Officer came to the conclusion that severing Ms. Davis__\nrelationship with her family in Canada __would not have a significant negative\nimpact on her that would constitute an unusual and undeserved or\ndisproportionate hardship__.\n \n[18]          \nThe final\, and perhaps most fundamental concern with the Officer__s\ndecision as it relates to the mental health aspect of Ms. Davis__ H&C\napplication is that it focuses almost exclusively on the availability of mental\nhealth care in St. Vincent. No real attention was paid to whether requiring Ms.\nDavis to return to St. Vincent to access that care would amount to undue\,\nundeserved or disproportionate hardship.   \n \n[19]          \nThe uncontradicted expert evidence before the PRRA Officer was that Ms.\nDavis would be at risk of a complete emotional breakdown if she were forced to\nreturn to St. Vincent\, which could well result in her becoming suicidal. In\nsuch circumstances\, it was not enough for the Officer to simply look at the availability\nof mental health care in St. Vincent. As Ms. Davis__ counsel put it\, even if the\nhealth care in St. Vincent was perfect\, the Officer still had to determine\nwhether putting Ms. Davis through all of this amounted to undue\, undeserved or\ndisproportionate hardship. This question was never really addressed by the\nOfficer\, further rendering the decision unreasonable. \n \nConclusion \n \n[20]          \nFor these reasons\, the application for judicial review is allowed. \n \n[21]          \nCiting Justice Phelan__s recent decision in Sivapatham v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2010 FC 314\, [2010] F.C.J.

Her application included her husband and their dependent daughter and\nwhen her daughter Zainab was born on April 9\, 2011\, she was added to the\napplication. The Applicant was found to be eligible\, having achieved the\nminimum 67 points required for the FSW category.\n[4]              \nAs part of the processing of the application and\ndetermining their admissibility to Canada\, the family attended medical\nexaminations. By letter dated March 26\, 2014\, the Applicant was informed that\nZainab had been determined to be a person whose health condition might\nreasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services\nin Canada and was therefore inadmissible under paragraph 38(1)(o) of the IRPA.\nThe Officer made the following assessment in the fairness letter:\nThis 2-year old female child has Down__s\nSyndrome with intellectual and speech impairment. Her medical condition will be\npresent throughout her life.\nIf admitted to Canada as a permanent\nresident\, she will be eligible for and will likely require a combination of\nhealth services and social services.\nFrom a health services perspective\, she\nwould require a full assessment and ongoing support from a team of specialists\nto include pediatricians\, neurologists\, and physiotherapists to share in her\nrehabilitation/therapy care.\nFrom a social services perspective and in\norder to meet her educational needs until she is 19\, she will likely be\nidentified as an exceptional student requiring special education suitable for a\nchild who is physically/mentally disabled/chronic health impaired. This special\neducation teacher/assistant and will include the services of a speech/language\ntherapist. Of note\, she comes from a caring supportive family and while she\nlives at home\, much of her attendant care is provided by her family. If she is\nadmitted to Canada\, her family will likely utilize intermittent community\nprovided respite care. Should she leave home\, she will likely require the\nservices of a personal care attendant. The provision of the above mentioned\nhealth services and social services are expensive and publicly funded.\n[5]              \nThe Applicant was provided with an opportunity\nto provide additional submissions prior to a decision being made\, which she did\nby letter dated May 16\, 2014. The Applicant indicated that she would be\nfinancially responsible for all of Zainab__s health and social services\, that\nshe had experience teaching children with Down__s Syndrome and would teach her\nown daughter and that Zainab does not currently have any serious health\nconditions and has an IQ very close to a __normal__ IQ for babies. The Applicant\nalso indicated in her letter that she was trying to obtain private health\ninsurance in Canada\, that she and Zainab would return to Pakistan annually to\ntake all necessary medical tests\, and that her sister-in-law would help provide\ncare for Zainab when the Applicant was unavailable. This letter was accompanied\nby letters attesting to Zainab__s health from a speech therapist\, a doctor\, a\nvision clinic and a cardiac centre and a letter from the Govt. College for\nWomen Sambrial attesting to the Applicant__s employment as a lecturer in\neducation\, that she holds a Master__s Degree in Education\, and that her\ncurriculum included the education of children with Down__s Syndrome.\nIII.            \nImpugned Decision\n[6]              \nA note in the Computer Assisted Immigration\nProcessing System [CAIPS] dated August 12\, 2014 indicates that a medical\nofficer reviewed the Applicant__s response and made the following assessment:\n__I am of the\nopinion that the new material does not modify the assessment of medical\ninadmissibility. The reason for this is that the child has Down__s syndrome with\nintellectual and speech impairment. The applicant__s health conditions will\nrequire services that are expensive and publicly funded\, therefore\, she remains\ninadmissible on health grounds. While the inadmissibility on health grounds\nremains\, the visa officer may consider the non-medical documents provided under\nprocedural fairness.\n[7]              \nThe Officer reviewed the Applicant__s response and\nthe medical officer__s assessment the same day. He or she acknowledged that\nZainab __does not suffer from a cardiac condition and\nenjoys good health\,__ but found that Zainab__s diagnosis was not contested\nby the Applicant\, that Down__s Syndrome is a permanent condition\, and that she\nis therefore an __exceptional child who will require a\nfull assessment\, as well as ongoing support throughout her childhood and\nrealistically\, her life.__ The Officer also acknowledged the Applicant__s\nstatements regarding Zainab__s education\, but noted that as an applicant in the\nFSW category\, it is expected that she will become economically established in\nCanada\, which would not be possible if she is homeschooling Zainab. The Officer\nwas concerned that there was no evidence to support the family-based respite\ncare and dismissed the Applicant__s stated intentions to obtain private health\ninsurance and to return to Pakistan to be assessed annually as being\nunrealistic and untenable given the availability of public healthcare in\nCanada. The Officer concluded that he or she was not satisfied that the\nApplicant had demonstrated that __she would be in a\nposition to mitigate the demands on social services that the admission of her\ndaughter would generate__.\n[8]              \nThe Officer__s decision was communicated to the\nApplicant by letter dated August 15\, 2014. The decision stated that pursuant to\nsubsection 42(a) of the Act\, the Applicant herself is inadmissible to Canada\nbecause her accompanying family member\, Zainab\, had been found to be\ninadmissible on health grounds in accordance with subsection 38(1) of the Act.\nIV.            \nLegislative Framework\n[9]              \nInadmissibility on health grounds due to\nexcessive demand on health or social services\, is governed by subsection 38(1)\nof the IRPA:\n\n\n\n\n38. (1) A foreign national is inadmissible on health grounds if\n  their health condition\n(a) is likely to be a danger to public health;\n(b) is likely to be a danger to public safety; or\n(c) might\n  reasonably be expected to cause excessive demand on health or social\n  services.\n \n\n\n38.

Such factual issues attract the deferential standard of reasonableness (Dunsmuir\nv New Brunswick\, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47\, [2008] 1 SCR 190).\n[13]          \nAs a general rule\, issues related to natural\njustice and procedural fairness __ including whether an Applicant has had a fair\nopportunity to know and meet the case\, and the determination of an officer__s\nobligations under the IRPA __ are reviewable under the standard of correctness (Mission\nInstitution v Khela\, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79\, [2014] 1 SCR 502; Canada\n(Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa\, 2009 SCC 12 at para 43\, [2009] 1 SCR\n339).\nVII.         \nAnalysis\nA.               \nDid the Officer fail to reasonably assess the\nApplicant__s plan to mitigate the excessive demand on Canada__s health and social\nservices?\n[14]          \nThe intent of the current\nmedical inadmissibility provisions is to avoid negative impacts on Canada__s\npublicly funded health and social services systems by refusing admission to\nprospective immigrants whose health conditions would create excessive demands\non health and social services in Canada. These objectives are to be attained\nwhile still recognizing that certain immigrant groups with compelling\nhumanitarian and compassionate reasons for entering Canada should not be barred\nfor health reasons.\n[15]          \nIn accordance with the\nleading decisions in this area of Hilewitz v Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, 2005 SCC 57\, [2005] 2 SCR 706 [Hilewitz] and\nSapru v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2011 FCA 35\, [2012] 4\nFCR 3 [Sapru]\, medical and visa officers must both conduct an\nindividualized assessment. Sapru explains that the medical officer\nshould assess the likely demands an applicant may make on services\, the\nscarcity or cost of the services\, and the willingness and ability of the family\nto pay for the services. In particular\, Sapru provides the following\nguidance\, stating that medical officers must: (i)__take into account both medical and\nnon-medical factors\,__  (ii) __provide the immigration officer with a\nmedical opinion about any health condition an applicant has and the likely cost\nof treating the condition\,__\nand (iii) __[w]hen an applicant\nsubmits a plan for managing the condition\, the medical officer must consider\nand advise the immigration officer about things such as the feasibility and\navailability of the plan__ (Sapru\nat para 36).\n[16]          \nSapru and De Hoedt Daniel v Canada (Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, 2012 FC 1391\, 422 FTR 69 [De Hoedt Daniel] clarify\nthat the visa officer may rely on the opinion of the medical officer on medical\nmatters. However\, the visa officer must assess the reasonableness of the\nmedical officer__s opinion regarding the expected excessive demand on health and\nsocial services\, and conduct a separate but similar determination on the\nfeasibility of an applicant__s plan to mitigate the cost of such services.\n[17]          \nThe Respondent provided a table which summarizes\nthe conclusions of the projected costs incurred over the first five years of\nthe Applicant gaining permanent residency as follows:\n\n\n\nSocial Service\n\n\nExtra Annual Cost\n\n\nYears Required\n\n\nTotal 5 Yr Cost\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Education\n  Extra Cost\n\n\n$17\,909\nto $23\,142\n\n\n5\n\n\n$89\,545\nto $115\,710\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Education\n  Assistant\n\n\n$35\,000\n\n\n5\n\n\n$175\,000\n\n\n\n\nSpeech Therapy\,\n  Occupation Therapy\, Social Worker (ongoing)\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n5\n\n\nVariable\n\n\n\n\nPsychological\n  Assessment\n\n\n$2\,500\nto $3\,000\n\n\n1\n\n\n$2\,500\nto $3\,000\n\n\n\n\nTotal Extra Cost\n\n\n$55\,409\nto $61\,142\n\n\n__blank__\n\n\n$267\,045\nto $293\,710\n\n\n\n[18]          \nEven if there was substance to the Applicant__s\nargument that a visa officer will err by\nfailing to consider the particular circumstances of an applicant prior to\nmaking a finding of medical inadmissibility\, including the applicant__s ability\nto pay for his or her own medical or social services\, and accepting for the\nsake of argument that little in the way of costs would be incurred\nduring the first two years of permanent residency\, the fact remains that for at\nleast 3 of the 5 consecutive years immediately following the assessment\, Zainab\nwould still cost the Ontario public school system an extra $17\,909 to $23\,142\nper year\, and an additional $35\,000 per year for a full-time education\nassistant.\n[19]          \nThe Applicant claims that her plan is workable\nas she would obtain private medical insurance for Zainab and personally\nhome-school her. I agree with the Respondent that the Applicant submitted no\ndocumentation from insurers willing to underwrite Zainab__s health care. Financial\nasset information and familial letters of support were also missing from the\nmitigation plan. The Applicant__s establishment in Canada is based on her\nobtaining employment as a member of the Federal Skilled Worker class\, which\nmakes speculative her proposed employment so that she can personally\nhome-school her daughter. I agree with the Respondent__s contention that the Officer\ncould reasonably conclude that the Applicant__s mitigation plan was not feasible\nand sustainable and with comments that the Applicant provided __no evidence to support__  the proposal.\nB.                \nDid the Officer err by failing to issue\nreasonably adequate reasons?\n[20]          \nIt follows from the foregoing\, that the Court is\nsatisfied with the reasons provided by the Officer.\nC.                \nDid the Officer breach the duty of procedural\nfairness by failing to convoke an interview?\n[21]          \nI tend to agree in some respects with the\nApplicant__s contention that the fairness letter is inadequate. I find that it\ncould point out more clearly the requirement for a mitigation plan. It is also\ninadequate in failing to provide the average Canadian per capita health\nservices and social services costs over a period of five consecutive years\, in\norder for the Applicant to have some idea of the degree of mitigation required so\nthat she may provide supporting financial information in support of the\nmitigation plan. In a close case\, this might have constituted a failure of\nprocedural fairness. However\, the margin of mitigation is of such a degree in\nthe present case\, that the issue does not arise.\nVIII.      \nConclusion\n[22]          \nFor the foregoing reasons\, the application is\ndismissed. There is no question for certification.\n\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURT__S JUDGMENT is that the\napplication is dismissed and that there is no question for certification.\n""Peter Annis""\n\nJudge\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL\nCOURT\nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCKET:\n\n\nIMM-7161-14\n \n\n\n\n\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n\n\nFOUZIA AKBAR v THE MINISTER OF\n  CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n \n\n\n\n\nPLACE OF\n  HEARING:\n\n\nToronto\, Ontario\n \n\n\n\n\nDATE OF\n  HEARING:\n\n\nJuly 14\, 2015\n \n\n\n\n\nREASONS\n  FOR JUDGMENT AND JUDGMENT:\n\n\nANNIS J.\n \n\n\n\n\nDATED:\n\n\njuly 28\, 2015\n \n\n\n\nAPPEARANCES:\n\n\n\nMatthew Jeffery\n \n\n\nFor\n  The Applicant\nFOUZIA\n  AKBAR\n \n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Bruce\n \n\n\nFor\n  The Respondent\nTHE\n  MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n \n\n\n\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD: \n\n\n\nMatthew Jeffery\nBarrister and Solicitor\nToronto\, Ontario\n \n\n\nFor\n  The Applicant\nFOUZIA\n  AKBAR\n \n\n\n\n\nWilliam F.

One difficulty that apparently remains unresolved is the\nintroduction\, in January of 2001\, of certain amendments to the In Flight Safety\nManual. Those amendments are at the root of this appeal.\n[2]              \nThe\nappellants were of the view and still believe that the amendments to the In Flight\nSafety Manual gave rise to certain risks to the health and safety of cabin\npersonnel. The appellants made a complaint under the internal complaint\nresolution process mandated by section 127.1 of the Canada Labour Code. When the\ncomplaints were not resolved to the satisfaction of the appellants\, the\ncomplaints were referred to a health and safety officer under subsection 127.1(8).\n[3]              \nThe\nduties and powers of a health and safety officer are described in subsections 127.1(9)\,\n(10) and (11) of the Canada Labour Code\, which read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n(9) The health and safety officer shall\n  investigate\, or cause another health and safety officer to investigate\, the\n  complaint referred to the officer under subsection (8). \n\n\n(9) L__agent de\n  sant_ et de s_curit_ saisi de la plainte fait enqu_te sur celle-ci ou charge\n  un autre agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ de le faire _ sa place.\n\n\n\n\n (10) On\n  completion of the investigation\, the health and safety officer \n(a) may issue directions to an employer or employee under\n  subsection 145(1);\n(b) may\, if in the officer__s opinion it is appropriate\, recommend\n  that the employee and employer resolve the matter between themselves; or\n(c) shall\, if the officer concludes that a danger exists as\n  described in subsection 128(1)\, issue directions under subsection 145(2).\n\n\n (10) Au terme de\n  l__enqu_te\, l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ : \na) peut donner _ l__employeur ou _\n  l__employ_ toute instruction pr_vue au paragraphe 145(1);\nb) peut\, s__il l__estime opportun\,\n  recommander que l__employeur et l__employ_ r_glent _ l__amiable la situation\n  faisant l__objet de la plainte;\nc) s__il conclut _ l__existence de l__une ou\n  l__autre des situations mentionn_es au paragraphe 128(1)\, donne des\n  instructions en conformit_ avec le paragraphe 145(2).\n\n\n\n\n(11) For greater certainty\, nothing in this section limits a health and\n  safety officer__s authority under section 145.\n\n\n(11) Il est entendu que les dispositions\n  du pr_sent article ne portent pas atteinte aux pouvoirs conf_r_s _ l__agent de\n  sant_ et de s_curit_ sous le r_gime de l__article 145.\n\n\n\n\n \n[4]              \nSubsections\n145(1) and (2) of the Canada Labour Code read as follows:\n\n\n\n\n145. (1) A health and safety officer who is of the opinion\n  that a provision of this Part is being contravened or has recently been\n  contravened may direct the employer or employee concerned\, or both\, to \n(a)\n  terminate the contravention within the time that the officer may specify; and\n(b) take steps\, as specified by\n  the officer and within the time that the officer may specify\, to ensure that\n  the contravention does not continue or re-occur.\n\n\n145.\n  (1) S__il est d__avis qu__une contravention _ la pr_sente partie vient d___tre\n  commise ou est en train de l___tre\, l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ peut\n  donner _ l__employeur ou _ l__employ_ en cause l__instruction : \na) d__y mettre\n  fin dans le d_lai qu__il pr_cise;\nb) de prendre\, dans les\n  d_lais pr_cis_s\, les mesures qu__il pr_cise pour emp_cher la continuation de\n  la contravention ou sa r_p_tition.\n\n\n\n\n[__]\n\n\n[__]\n\n\n\n\n(2) If a health and safety\n  officer considers that the use or operation of a machine or thing\, a\n  condition in a place or the performance of an activity constitutes a danger\n  to an employee while at work\, \n(a) the officer shall notify the employer of the\n  danger and issue directions in writing to the employer directing the\n  employer\, immediately or within the period that the officer specifies\, to\n  take measures to \n(i) correct the hazard or condition or alter the activity\n  that constitutes the danger\, or\n(ii) protect any person from the danger; and\n(b)\n  the officer may\, if the officer considers that the danger or the hazard\,\n  condition or activity that constitutes the danger cannot otherwise be\n  corrected\, altered or protected against immediately\, issue a direction in\n  writing to the employer directing that the place\, machine\, thing or activity\n  in respect of which the direction is issued not be used\, operated or\n  performed\, as the case may be\, until the officer__s directions are complied\n  with\, but nothing in this paragraph prevents the doing of anything necessary\n  for the proper compliance with the direction.\n\n\n(2)\n  S__il estime que l__utilisation d__une machine ou chose\, une situation existant\n  dans un lieu de travail ou l__accomplissement d__une t_che constitue un danger\n  pour un employ_ au travail\, l__agent : \na)\n  en avertit l__employeur et lui enjoint\, par instruction _crite\, de proc_der\,\n  imm_diatement ou dans le d_lai qu__il pr_cise\, _ la prise de mesures propres :\n  \n(i) soit _ _carter le risque\, _\n  corriger la situation ou _ modifier la t_che\,\n(ii) soit _ prot_ger les personnes\n  contre ce danger;\nb) peut en\n  outre\, s__il estime qu__il est impossible dans l__imm_diat de prendre les\n  mesures pr_vues _ l__alin_a a)\, interdire\, par instruction _crite\n  donn_e _ l__employeur\, l__utilisation du lieu\, de la machine ou de la chose ou\n  l__accomplissement de la t_che en cause jusqu___ ce que ses instructions aient\n  _t_ ex_cut_es\, le pr_sent alin_a n__ayant toutefois pas pour effet d__emp_cher\n  toute mesure n_cessaire _ la mise en oeuvre des instructions.\n\n\n\n\n[5]              \nThe\nhealth and safety officer\, Mr. Jacques Servant\, decided not to issue a\ndirection under subsection 145(1) or (2). Instead\, with respect to two of the\ncomplaints\, he accepted an __assurance of voluntary compliance__ from Air Canada with respect\nto the establishment and training of local health and safety committees. The\nremaining complaints were effectively dismissed.\n[6]              \nMr.\nServant__s decision is set out in a letter dated May 7\, 2001\, the key parts of which\nread as follows (Appeal Book\, page 310):\n\n\n\n\nOur concerns as a Health and Safety\n  Inspector relate to the local Health and Safety committees. Our investigation\n  indicates a lack of knowledge/education of the workplace committee members.\n  CUPE trained the employee representatives and Air Canada does not train the employer\n  representatives. Counselling and training must be conducted together to\n  understand the intent of the legislation. A good education program is the key\n  to creating an effective workplace committee. The administrative roles and\n  responsibilities of those involved in the workplace committee must be clearly\n  understood. Committees are required by law to establish rules and procedures\n  relating to the terms of office of members and to their operation.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that occupational health and\n  safety becomes part of the overall corporate decision making process\,\n  Managers in each department of the company must be aware that decisions\n  regarding changes on-board aircraft may affect the aircrew__s work and create\n  hazards in their workplace. Decisions and initiatives shall be discussed with\n  the policy committee. These concerns were conveyed to Air Canada by requesting assurances of\n  voluntary compliance.\n\n\n\n\nWe could not find any evidence that Air\n  Canada has contravened the employer__s general duty to ensure that the safety\n  and health at work of every person employed by the employer is protected. In\n  fact\, by having a required flight attendant manual where safety and emergency\n  procedures are set out demonstrates that the employer assumes his\n  responsibilities under section 124.\n\n\n\n\n[7]              \nThe\nappellants believe that the investigation of their complaints was biased and\nflawed in a number of respects\, and that the resulting decision of Mr. Servant\nis similarly flawed. The parties have agreed that\, for the purposes of this\nappeal\, the Court should assume that these complaints are justified. The\nappellants filed a notice of appeal of his decision under subsection 146(1) of the\nCanada Labour Code\, which reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n146. (1) An employer\, employee or trade\n  union that feels aggrieved by a direction issued by a health and safety\n  officer under this Part may appeal the direction in writing to an appeals\n  officer within thirty days after the date of the direction being issued or\n  confirmed in writing.\n\n\n146.\n  (1) Tout\n  employeur\, employ_ ou syndicat qui se sent l_s_ par des instructions donn_es\n  par l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ en vertu de la pr_sente partie peut\, dans\n  les trente jours qui suivent la date o_ les instructions sont donn_es ou\n  confirm_es par _crit\, interjeter appel de celles-ci par _crit _ un agent\n  d__appel. \n\n\n\n\n \n[8]              \nAn appeals\nofficer\, Mr. Douglas Malanka\, considered the matter and concluded that he lacked\nthe statutory authority to consider an appeal of a decision by a health and\nsafety officer not to issue a direction under section 145. The appellants\ncommenced an application for judicial review of the decision of Mr. Malanka. On\nJune 1\, 2006\, Justice Hughes dismissed the application for judicial review but\ngave the appellants an extension of time for filing an application for judicial\nreview of the decision of the health and safety officer\, Mr. Servant (2006 FC\n673). The appellants now appeal the decision of Justice Hughes.\n[9]              \nThe\nappellants argue that the decision of Justice Hughes is based on an incorrect\ninterpretation of subsection 146(1) of the Canada Labour Code\, and that\nJustice Hughes afforded the decision of Mr. Malanka too much deference on\nthe question of the interpretation of that provision. In the alternative\, the\nappellants argue that if section 146(1) was correctly interpreted by Justice\nHughes and Mr. Malanka\, it is a breach of section 7 of the Canadian Charter\nof Rights and Freedoms and should be amended by a judicial __reading in__ of\nwords that would permit the appellants to pursue their appeal of the decision\nof Mr. Servant not to issue a direction.\n[10]          \nWe\nare all of the view that the interpretation of subsection 146(1) adopted by Justice\nHughes and Mr. Malanka is correct. Subsection 146(1) of the Canada Labour\nCode grants an employer\, an employee or a trade union a right to appeal any\ndirection by a health and safety officer under section 145\, but does not grant\nanyone a right to appeal a decision by a health and safety officer not to issue\na direction. We do not consider it necessary to consider the issue of the\nstandard of review that was or should have been applied by Justice Hughes in\nreviewing the decision of Mr. Malanka.\n[11]          \nWe\nsee no merit in the argument of the appellants that section 7 of the Charter is\nbreached by subsection 146(1) of the Canada Labour Code. It is well\nestablished that there is no constitutional right to appeal\, even in matters\nwith a significant effect on the life\, liberty and security of the person (Kourtessis\nv. Canada (Minister of National Revenue)\,  [1993] 2 S.C.R. 52 (per Justice\nLa Forest); Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2007] 1\nS.C.R. 350 at paragraph 136; Huynh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, [1996] 2 F.C. 976; Canada (Secretary of State) v. Luitjens\n(1992) 142 N.R. 173 (F.C.A.)). Section 7 of the Charter does not require Parliament\nto provide a statutory right to appeal a decision of a health and safety\nofficer. Nevertheless\, Parliament has provided a statutory right to appeal the\nissuance of a section 145 direction by a health and safety officer. We see no\nbasis for concluding that\, because of section 7 of the Charter\, the existence\nof that limited right of appeal means that there must also be a right to appeal\nthe decision of a health and safety officer not to issue such a direction.\n[12]          \nThis\nappeal will be dismissed with costs.\n__K.

Introduction\n[1]              \nThis is an application for judicial review\npursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\,\nSC 2001 c 27 (IRPA) of a decision dated September 10\, 2013\, by Carlos\nCosta\, an immigration officer with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC\,\nimmigration officer)\, refusing the applicant__s application for permanent\nresidence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C application).\nII.        Facts\n[2]              \nThe applicant is a Belgian citizen who was born\non January 26\, 1960\, and arrived in Canada on February 24\, 2003.\n[3]              \nHis spouse\, whom he married on February 24\, 2010\,\nafter approximately seven years together\, has HIV. The diagnosis was made in\nJanuary 2008.\n[4]              \nIn Belgium\, the applicant was convicted of forgery\,\nusing forged documents\, breach of trust and embezzlement in 1984\, and of\nforgery\, using forged documents\, fraud and possession of stolen property in 2003.\n[5]              \nThe applicant filed a refugee protection claim\non February 27\, 2007\, which was rejected by the Immigration and Refugee Board\non February 10\, 2010. The Federal Court of Canada dismissed his application for\nleave and judicial review regarding that rejection.\n[6]              \nIn July 2010\, he filed an initial H&C\napplication accompanied by a sponsorship application by his spouse. A CIC\nimmigration officer refused that application on January 14\, 2013. The H&C\napplication relied on the applicant__s settlement in Canada and on his marriage to\nhis spouse. On January 31\, 2012\, the applicant filed an application for leave\nand judicial review with respect to that refusal\, but abandoned it after the respondent\noffered to reconsider his H&C application.\n[7]              \nThat reconsideration took place on September 10\,\n2013\, and it is the CIC__s refusal at the end of that process that is the\nsubject of this application for judicial review.\n[8]              \nMeanwhile\, in September 2010\, the applicant\nfiled a pre-removal risk assessment application\, which was rejected in May\n2011.\nIII.       Impugned\ndecision\n[9]              \nAfter summarizing the applicant__s arguments and stating\nthe applicable legal framework and burden of proof in the case\, the immigration\nofficer refused the H&C application.\n[10]          \nAccording to him\, the fact that the H&C\napplication was accompanied by a sponsorship application prepared by the\napplicant__s spouse was a positive aspect\, but the applicant did not submit a\nQuebec Selection Certificate (QSC) or demonstrate that he took steps to obtain\nit\, which was a negative aspect. Furthermore\, CIC attached little weight to the\napplicant__s argument concerning the importance of his relationship because he\nattempted to settle permanently in Canada only after he had lived with his\nspouse for seven years.\n[11]          \nThe immigration officer also attached little\nweight to the applicant__s argument concerning his spouse__s state of health\, finding\nthat the applicant did not submit evidence that his spouse is unable to work or\nsupport himself because of his HIV diagnosis.\n[12]          \nLittle weight was given to the applicant__s\nargument that he has not stopped working since he arrived in Canada because he did not work from September 2007 to April 2009 and did not submit\nevidence of income from 2004 to 2009 as well as from 2010 until today.\nMoreover\, the applicant stated that he started working in 2003 whereas his\nrecord in the immigration information system shows that he got his first work\npermit in 2007. Thus\, either the applicant contradicted himself in that respect\nor he worked illegally in Canada for four years.\n[13]          \nThe immigration officer was of the opinion that\nthe applicant did not demonstrate that his extended stay in Canada was not the result of an inability to leave the country or circumstances that were out\nof his control. Finally\, CIC attached significant weight to a negative aspect\nof the H&C application\, that is\, the fact that the applicant did not claim\nrefugee protection until 2007 even though he arrived in Canada in 2003 and consequently stayed in the country illegally for several years. \n[14]          \nThe applicant stated that he would have nowhere\nto stay in his country of origin and that he would not be able to find\nemployment there\, but the immigration officer found that he has family in his\ncountry of birth and that the skills that he has acquired here would be\ntransferable. Consequently\, CIC did not attach a lot of weight to that argument.\n[15]          \nRegarding the applicant__s settlement in Canada\, the immigration officer found that the fact that the applicant__s spouse is a\nCanadian citizen and lives here does not automatically mean that the applicant\nis settled in the country.\nIV.       Applicant__s arguments\n\n[16]          \nThe applicant claims that the immigration\nofficer__s decision is not reasonable for various reasons.\n[17]          \nHe states that CIC misinterpreted the system\, that\nis\, the decision-making process surrounding the processing of an H&C\napplication regarding the issuance of a QSC. The immigration officer wrongly\ndrew a negative inference from the absence of a QSC in the applicant__s record\, as\nthe applicant was unable to submit a QSC because a request in that respect can\nonly be made after an H&C application has successfully passed its first stage\,\nwhich was not the case. \n[18]          \nFurthermore\, it was not reasonable to doubt the\nrelationship between the applicant and his spouse by stating that seven years had\npassed before a permanent residence application was filed. Such reasoning\ndisregards the proceedings undertaken by the applicant over the years\, namely\nhis refugee protection claim.\n[19]          \nThe immigration officer also erred in his\nassessment of the potential consequences of the applicant__s departure on his\nspouse\, who has HIV. The decision refers only to the relationship of financial\ndependence between the spouses and completely eliminates the concept of the moral\nand psychological support between the spouses\, who were required to go through\nsignificant hardship because the applicant__s spouse was diagnosed with HIV. The\napplicant reasonably expected the immigration officer to explain why he did not\naccept that important argument\, which is at the heart of the application and\nwhich makes their application\, notwithstanding the decision\, exceptional relative\nto other couples. The applicant also claims that CIC\, in its decision\, lacked\ncompassion for persons with HIV by barely touching on the daily reality of a\ncouple where at least one member has the virus.\n[20]          \nFinally\, the immigration officer should have\nconsidered the fact that the applicant has a criminal record in Belgium and\nthat the processing of a permanent residence application from outside Canada\nwould consequently be longer and that\, during that time\, the applicant would\nnot be able to offer the daily moral and psychological support that he has been\noffering his spouse for years. \nV.        Respondent__s arguments\n\n[21]          \nThe respondent claims that the decision is\ncompletely reasonable\, mainly because it constitutes the result of the exercise\nof a highly discretionary power that requires a reviewing court to show\ndeference and respect. Furthermore\, the immigration officer repeated passages\nfrom the applicant__s written submissions word for word\, which indicates that\nthe decision-maker was attentive to the applicant__s claims. Furthermore\, had it\nbeen made\, proof of the applicant__s settlement in Canada would not have been\nsufficient to obtain a positive response\, and the applicant refused to have his\napplication processed in the spouse/common-law partner class.\n[22]          \nIn addition\, the respondent adds the following\nin reply to the applicant__s arguments. First\, the burden was on him to prove\nhis allegations concerning the moral and psychological support that he and his\nspouse provide each other because of the illness. In that regard\, the applicant\nsubmitted nothing except for his written submissions\, and the respondent\nspecifies that the separation of a couple cannot in itself justify a positive\ndecision. Furthermore\, the immigration officer__s finding regarding the absence\nof a QSC in the applicant__s record was not determinative in the outcome of the\nH&C application. The mere fact of having stated that many people with HIV\nlead a normal life despite their illness is not reflective of a lack of\ncompassion on the part of the immigration officer. Finally\, it is unthinkable\nthat the existence of a criminal record should favour a positive determination\nbecause that would result in preferential treatment for people who have a\ncriminal record over those who have never come into conflict with the law. \nVI.       Issue\n[23]          \nDid the CIC immigration officer err by refusing\nthe H&C application?\nVII.     Standard of\nreview\n[24]          \nIt is well established that a decision rendered\nby a CIC officer in an H&C application must be reviewed on the standard of\nreasonableness (Kisana v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2009 FCA 189 at paragraph 18\, [2009] FCJ No 713 (Kisana); see for example\, George\nv Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2012 FC 1240 at paragraph\n31\, [2012] FCJ No 1348).\n[25]          \nAs a result\, the Court should be careful not to\nintervene if the immigration officer__s finding is justified\, transparent and\nintelligible and if it falls within a range of possible\, acceptable outcomes\nwhich are defensible in respect of the facts and law (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick\,\n2008 SCC 9 at paragraph 47\, [2008] SCJ No 9). \nVIII.    Analysis\n[26]          \nBefore beginning the analysis of this case\, it\nwould be advisable to state the legal framework in which an H&C application\nis filed. In filing such an application\, under section 25 of the IRPA\, foreign\nnationals intend to be relieved of\, for humanitarian and compassionate reasons\,\ntheir general obligation to file their application for permanent residence from\noutside the country. In order for foreign nationals to be provided the relief\nsought\, which also constitutes the exception to the rule\, they must prove their\nallegations__the burden is on them (see Kisana\, above\, at paragraph 35;\nOwusu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FCA 38 at\nparagraph 5\, [2004] 2 FCR 635). Thus\, in this case\, it was up to the applicant\nto convince the immigration officer that his personal situation was such that the\nfiling of his application for permanent residence from abroad would lead to\nunusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\n[27]          \nFurthermore\, as indicated by the respondent\, it\nis true that the power conferred by section 25 of the IRPA is highly\ndiscretionary (see Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n[1999] SCJ No 39 at paragraphs 51-53) and it is also important to note that a\nreasonable exercise of that discretionary power may result in a wider scope of\npossible outcomes (see for example L.A.H. v Canada (Minister of Employment\nand Immigration)\, 2012 FC 337 paragraph 18\, [2012] FCJ No 353). And despite\nthe fact that reviewing courts cannot substitute their own appreciation of the\nappropriate solution or re-weigh the evidence (Canada (Citizenship\nand Immigration) v Khosa\, 2009 SCC 12 at paragraph 59\, [2009] SCJ No 12)\, they\ncan nevertheless examine the justified\, transparent and intelligible nature of\nthe decision rendered (Dunsmuir\, above\, at paragraph 47).\n[28]          \nIt is therefore within the limits of that legal\nframework and for the following reasons that this Court states that the\ndecision by the immigration officer to refuse the applicant__s H&C\napplication that is under review here is unreasonable and that the matter must\nbe referred back to another immigration officer for redetermination.\n[29]          \nThe immigration officer__s primary error is the\nresult of a misapprehension of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate\nhardship as it relates to the radically different reality that the applicant\nand his spouse live with relative to most couples\, at least regarding one\naspect of their life\, that is\, the illness. For many years\, they have mutually\nsupported each other and have provided each other with needed moral and psychological\nsupport to confront the challenges that being infected with HIV brings. That\nreality inevitably disrupts their individual everyday life and their life as a\ncouple. The applicant has reason to claim that the moral and psychological\nsupport in their relationship is an essential component of his H&C\napplication and he was entitled to expect the issue to be addressed by the\nimmigration officer because it was important. The immigration officer\ncompletely eliminated that notion in his reasoning; for CIC\, only the financial\nsupport seemed to be taken into consideration. Although the applicant emphasized\nthe financial support between himself and his spouse in his written submissions\,\nthe fact remains that he addressed the moral and psychological aspect of the\nsupport in their relationship\, and the decision does not explain why that crucial\nissue was not accepted. Without suggesting that the immigration officer lacked\ncompassion for persons with HIV\, that is an unreasonable error.\n[30]          \nAn assessment of the decision reveals other less\nserious errors. First\, the immigration officer stated that he attached little\nsignificance to the applicant__s argument that he has been in a relationship\nwith his spouse for many years on the grounds that he filed an application in\nthe aim of settling permanently in Canada after living with his spouse for\nseven years. By finding as such\, the immigration officer seems to have not taken\ninto consideration the proceedings undertaken by the applicant since his\narrival: he filed a refugee protection claim in 2007 (which was rejected in\n2010)\, an application for leave and judicial review of the rejection of his\nrefugee claim (which was dismissed)\, a pre-removal risk assessment application (which\nwas rejected)\, an initial H&C application in 2011 and a reconsideration of\nthat H&C application in 2013 (which led to this application for judicial\nreview). It was\, however\, relevant for the immigration officer to point out\nthat\, in the absence of evidence to the contrary\, the applicant seems to have\nstayed in Canada without status for some time__more specifically\, from the time\nhis visitor__s visa expired on May 23\, 2003\, until February 14\, 2007\, when\nhis refugee claim was filed__but given the proceedings undertaken by the\napplicant\, it is completely unreasonable to suggest that he waited until he had\nlived with his spouse for seven years before taking steps to remain in Canada\,\nespecially since the immigration officer minimized the importance of the\napplicant__s relationship because of that finding. \n[31]          \nThen\, the immigration officer also erred\nregarding the QSC. In fact\, according to the process in place for the processing\nof H&C applications\, which is in two stages\, a QSC can only be requested\nand obtained if an H&C application had been approved in principle at the\nfirst stage. It was therefore completely unreasonable for the immigration\nofficer to draw a negative inference from the absence of a QSC in the\napplicant__s record. The erroneous finding in that regard is perhaps not fatal\nin itself for the outcome of the H&C application in this case\, but it\nundermined the weight the officer attached to the fact that the H&C\napplication was accompanied by a sponsorship application\, which\, in addition to\nthe other errors that have already been mentioned\, most certainly contributed\nto the outcome of an unreasonable finding.\n[32]          \nHowever\, it was completely reasonable for the\nimmigration officer to note certain problems in the application. For example\,\nthe applicant did not provide financial data for certain years in Canada. Also\, the applicant__s argument that his H&C application should have received a\npositive determination because he has a criminal record is flawed for obvious\nreasons raised by the respondent in his submissions: such a situation would result\nin giving preferential treatment to people who have come into conflict with the\nlaw over those who have no criminal record. That being said\, I am of the\nopinion that those problems in the H&C application at the heart of this\nmatter cannot compensate for the errors made by the immigration officer that\nfatally undermine the decision\, especially regarding the moral and\npsychological support the applicant provides to his spouse and the unusual and\nundeserved or disproportionate hardship that their potential separation would cause\nin that regard.\n[33]          \nThe parties were invited to submit a question\nfor certification\, but none was proposed.\n\n\n\n\nORDER\nTHE COURT ORDERS that:\n\nThe application\n     for judicial review is allowed;\nThe immigration\n     officer__s decision refusing the H&C application is set aside;\nThe matter is\n     referred back to another immigration officer for redetermination;\n\n4.

In broad terms\, the Judgment under appeal set aside a\ndecision\, and subsequent variations and reconsiderations of that decision\, by\nthe Minister of Health (the Minister) under the Natural Health Products\nRegulations (S.O.R./2003-196) (the Regulations). The effect of those\ndecisions was to refuse a product licence (Natural Health Product Licence) to\nthe respondent\, The Winning Combination Inc. (TWC)\, in respect of Resolve\, a\nproduct that may assist in cessation from smoking. After finding that\ngovernmental officials involved in the regulatory review process were biased\nand that there had been multiple breaches of procedural fairness\, the judge\nissued an order of mandamus compelling the Minister to issue a Natural\nProduct Licence to the respondent. He granted costs of the application to TWC\non a full indemnity basis.\n[2]              \nAt the heart of the Attorney General__s appeal\nlies the order of mandamus. The Attorney General contends that the judge\nerred in law in issuing mandamus and in so doing usurped a duty vested\nin the Minister under the Regulations. The Attorney General also\ncontends that the judge erred in concluding that his findings of bias meant\nthat there could be no fair and objective assessment of TWC__s application\, and\nin placing a burden on the Minister to demonstrate circumstances to the\nopposite effect. The Attorney General further contends that the judge erred in\nreceiving and relying on evidence that was not before the Minister\, erred in\nfirst striking and later relying on certain evidence and erred in principle in\nawarding solicitor and client costs.\n[3]              \nAt the outset of the hearing of the appeal\, the\nAttorney General conceded that the licensing decision and reconsideration process\nunder the Regulations had not been reached in accordance with procedural\nfairness. However\, the Attorney General maintained her position that the order\nof mandamus be set aside and that the question of whether a Natural\nProduct Licence should be issued in respect of Resolve be remitted to the\nMinister for redetermination.\n[4]              \nThis concession was appropriate. There was no\nerror in the Federal Court__s factual findings relevant to procedural fairness\,\nnor in the application of the principles of procedural fairness to those\nfindings. The judge found multiple breaches of procedural fairness throughout\nthe licensing and subsequent reconsideration process\, and was correct in doing\nso. The Court did not understand the Attorney General to be conceding bias\, at\nleast on a systemic level\, given her position that the matter be returned to\nthe Minister.\n[5]              \nBefore the Federal Court\, TWC advanced other\ngrounds on which it claimed it was entitled to relief. To supplement its\nposition that it was entitled to mandamus\, TWC argued that once the\nMinister had decided that Resolve was classified as a natural health product\,\nthe doctrines of functus officio and estoppel precluded the Minister\nfrom reversing her decision. In light of his findings with respect to\nprocedural fairness\, bias and the unreasonableness of the decision\, these\ngrounds were not addressed by the judge but are raised again by TWC before this\nCourt.\n[6]              \nFor the reasons that follow\, the appeal should\nbe allowed\, in part.\nI.                  \nLegislative framework\n[7]              \nIn order to set the stage for what is a rather\nextensive review of the history of this proceeding\, a description of key\nelements of the regulatory scheme governing natural health products (NHPs) and\nits distinction from the regulatory scheme governing drugs is required.\n[8]              \nThis Court\, and the Federal Court\, are familiar\nwith the drug approval process under the Food and Drugs Act (R.S.C.\, 1985\, c. F-27). Although there is similarity in some of the terms between the\nregulations governing drugs and NHPs\, they do not necessarily share the same\nscientific or empirical regulatory requirements. The regimes for approval of\ndrugs and NHPs are legally and operationally discrete. Subsection 3 of the Regulations\nmakes this clear; unless expressly indicated\, the Food and Drug Regulations\n(C.R.C.\, c. 870) do not apply to NHPs.\n[9]              \nThe Minister of Health is responsible for the\nadministration of the Regulations. The Health Products and Food Branch\nof Health Canada includes the Natural Health Products Directorate (NHPD\, now\nthe Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate)\, responsible for\nthe licensing of NHPs\, and the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate\n(HPFBI)\, responsible for compliance and enforcement activities.\n[10]          \nSelling a NHP in Canada requires a licence\,\nwhich is to be obtained by application to the Minister. The Product Licence\nApplication (PLA) shall\, pursuant to subsection 5(g) of the Regulations\,\ninclude __information that supports the safety and\nefficacy of the natural health product__. Section 6 directs the Minister\nto dispose of applications within 60 days in cases where safety and efficacy\ninformation submitted by an applicant is limited to that within the Department\nof Health__s Compendium of Monographs. Subsection 7(d) provides that the\nMinister __shall__ issue a licence if the product\nis __not likely to result in injury to the health of a\npurchaser or consumer.__\n[11]          \nThe Regulations provide the Minister with\na wide range of powers to administer and enforce the regime. Sections 16 to 19\ngive the Minister the authority at any time to request information from a\nlicence holder where reasonable grounds exist that the product may no longer be\nsafe. The Minister may issue a direction to stop sales if no response is\nforthcoming. The Minister may suspend a licence where reasonable grounds exist\nthat a licence holder has contravened the Act or Regulations or there has\nbeen a false or misleading statement in the information submitted under section\n5 in a PLA. The Minister may also suspend a licence at any time\, and without an\nopportunity for the licence holder to be heard\, where there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe it is necessary to prevent injury to the health of the\nconsumer.\n[12]          \nSave in circumstances where suspension is necessary\nto prevent injury\, sections 19 and 20 of the Regulations require the\nMinister to give the licence holder both notice and an opportunity to be heard before\na suspension takes effect and\, once suspended\, before taking administrative\naction to reinstate or cancel a suspended licence. So too at the application\nstage; section 9 requires that reasons for refusal (Notice of Refusal or NOR)\nto issue a licence be given\, and provides a process by which an applicant may\nrequest reconsideration with the associated opportunity to be heard.\n[13]          \nThere is a threshold question that must\nnecessarily be answered to determine the applicability of the Regulations\nto a particular product\, and that is whether the product that is the subject of\nan application is a NHP. __Natural health product__\nis defined in subsection 1(1) as a substance listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations.\nSchedule 1 states that\, inter alia\, a natural health product substance is\,\n__[a] plant or a plant material\, an alga\, a bacterium\, a\nfungus or a non-human animal material__ (Item 1). Item 2 of the Schedule\nprovides that a natural health product substance includes __[a]n extract or isolate of a substance described in item 1\,\nthe primary molecular structure of which is identical to that which it had\nprior to its extraction or isolation__.\n[14]          \nThe question of classification of a substance\, either\nas a NHP or as a drug\, determines which regulatory scheme is engaged and\, in\nconsequence\, the nature of the evidence that must be provided in support of the\nlicence application. There is an inherent logic to this. If natural health products\nwere to be subject to the same regulatory requirements and standards as drugs\,\na separate regulatory regime would not have been required.\nII.               \nHistory of the proceeding\nA.               \nThe licence application for Resolve\n[15]          \nThe Regulations came into force in\nJanuary 2004. The series of events under review began with the 2004 application\nby the then-owner of Resolve to the NHPD for a Natural Product Licence. Consistent\nwith departmental practice\, as the Active Ingredient in Resolve was listed in\nthe Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP)\, the NHPD concluded on December 2\,\n2004\, that Resolve fell within the definition of a NHP within Schedule 1 to the\nRegulations. The application for Resolve was given a PLA submission\nnumber.\n[16]          \nTWC purchased the rights to Resolve in 2006 and\nbegan to sell the product in Canada in October of that year. However\, in\nDecember of 2006\, Health Canada received a complaint from Pfizer Canada Inc. (Pfizer)\,\nalleging health and safety concerns related to Resolve. The complaint asserted\nthat the description of the pharmacology of the product suggested that it\nshould be regulated as a drug. This complaint triggered an internal inquiry by\nthe HPFBI\, that part of Health Canada responsible for regulatory compliance. Responsibility\nfor the inquiry was assigned to Mr. Paul Gustafson.\n[17]          \nFive months later\, on May 4\, 2007\, Mr. Gustafson\nsent TWC a warning letter\, requesting that it stop the sale and advertising of\nResolve and recall the product from the market. This request was based on an\nalleged contravention of the Act and Regulations and a determination\nthat Resolve posed a risk to health. The letter stated that\, as Resolve was a NHP\nsubject to the Regulations\, it could not be sold or advertised without a\nlicence. Further\, a Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) requested as part of the\ninvestigation had resulted in classification of the product as a Type II Health\nHazard. A Type II Health Hazard is defined as __a situation in which the use of\, or exposure to\, a product may\ncause temporary or mild to moderate adverse health consequences or where the\nprobability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.__ Health Canada concluded\, among other things\, that Resolve contained\na substance that was derived from passion flower and that there was a risk of\nat least a temporary or mild adverse health consequence.\n[18]          \nIn its response TWC noted that it was taken by\nsurprise\, particularly with respect to the safety and efficacy concerns raised\nby Health Canada. TWC took the position that the requests to stop sale\,\nadvertising and the recall of Resolve were unwarranted\, but indicated its\nwillingness to meet and work with Health Canada to resolve the situation.\n[19]          \nApproximately one month later\, on June 20\, 2007\,\nin response to information submitted by TWC\, Health Canada issued a revised HHE\nwhich confirmed the Type II Health Hazard classification and alleged regulatory\ncontravention. Health Canada requested once again that TWC immediately stop the\nsale and advertising of\, and recall\, Resolve.\n[20]          \nThis triggered a meeting between TWC and Health\nCanada officials on June 28\, 2007. At that meeting\, TWC was provided with\nanother revised HHE which confirmed that there was no residual passion flower\nin Resolve\, but noted a report of an adverse reaction\n(Adverse Reaction Report or ARR) as establishing a __serious__\ncase with a __possible__ causality between the use\nof Resolve and symptoms reported by a patient. The\njudge determined that neither the classification of Resolve as a NHP nor its\nefficacy was raised as a concern at the meeting.\n[21]          \nAt the close of the meeting\, TWC agreed\, on an\ninterim basis\, to comply with the stop sale and advertising requests made by\nHealth Canada\, but the issue of a recall was left in abeyance. Correspondence\nwas exchanged by the parties on the issue\, and TWC submitted written materials\,\nalong with 16 attachments and a subsequent expert opinion\, in order to address\nthe issues raised in the investigation. Health Canada was not satisfied. It\nultimately issued a public advisory\, which stated that Resolve was not\nauthorized for sale\, TWC had not complied with Health Canada__s recall request\,\nand advised Canadians not to use Resolve because of its potential health risk.\n[22]          \nAt the risk of disrupting the chain of events\, I\nwill jump forward in the chronology to note that\, by September 18\, 2008\, Health\nCanada conceded that it had no safety concerns with respect to Resolve.\n[23]          \nOn July 19\, 2007\, the NHPD issued a Notice of\nRefusal (the July NOR). TWC__s application was rejected on the basis of\nsubsections 7(a) and (d) of the Regulations\, including in particular a lack\nof sufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of the product. The July NOR expressed concerns over the Active Ingredient__s potential\neffects on the liver\, the scientific evidence submitted in support\, the\ntherapeutic benefit of Resolve and its recommended dosage. It cited the ARR noted\nin the prior HHE as establishing a __possible__ causality\nbetween the use of Resolve and the symptoms reported by a patient. No mention was made in the July NOR of any concern as to whether\nResolve was properly classified as a NHP.\n[24]          \nTWC sought recourse. It filed both a request for\nreconsideration on July 26\, 2007 under subsection 9(2) of the Regulations\n(Request for Reconsideration)\, and an application for judicial review of\nthe July NOR.\n[25]          \nApproximately one month following the Request\nfor Reconsideration\, on August 21\, 2007\, NHPD wrote to TWC __adjusting__ the grounds for the July NOR (the\nAdjustment Letter). Resolve was no longer considered to be a NHP\, but rather a\ndrug\, and therefore subject to regulation under the Food and Drug\nRegulations. The letter stated that NHPD relied\, in part\, on the DNP for\nclassification\, but that a review of the DNP__s sources led the NHPD to determine\nthat its inclusion of the Active Ingredient was in error. NHPD took the\nposition that the Active Ingredient __is in fact a\nsynthetic substance that does not occur naturally__. TWC accordingly\namended its Notice of Application to include judicial review of the Adjustment\nLetter.\n[26]          \nThe grounds upon which the Adjustment Letter\nrelied represented the first time that NHPD had directly addressed the question\nof the classification of Resolve as a NHP with TWC. The judge found that the\nlicence application had proceeded up to that date on the basis that Resolve was\nclassified as a NHP\, a determination that he found to have been confirmed on\nDecember 2\, 2004\, January 25\, 2007 and June 18\, 2007.\n[27]          \nThere was evidence before the judge that the DNP\nwas the authoritative reference in North America for natural health products.\nIt was at the time\, the definitive reference source used by the NHPD with\nrespect to classification of natural health products. It was on the basis of\nthe DNP that Resolve had originally been classified as a NHP. However\, on\nSeptember 11\, 2007\, the Active Ingredient in Resolve was removed from the DNP.\n[28]          \nThe judge found that this de-listing occurred at\nthe instigation of Dr. Robin Marles\, the Director of the Bureau of Clinical\nTrials and Health Sciences at NHPD\, and the official who oversaw the HHE\nprocess. While the __motivation and sequence of events\nwere murky__ leading up to the Adjustment Letter\, the judge found it was\nclear at that time that the Active Ingredient was still listed in the DNP and\nthat neither Dr. Marles nor Health Canada had evidence to suggest that it was\nnot a natural product. No notice had been given to TWC of this change in\nposition\, nor was it given an opportunity to make submissions on the point before\nthe Adjustment Letter was issued.\nB.                \nReconsideration process __ August 2007 to January\n30\, 2012\n[29]          \nI turn now to the reconsideration process\, a\nregulatory review or appeal mechanism established under subsection 9(2) of the Regulations.\n[30]          \nBeginning in late August 2007 and continuing\nthroughout the lengthy reconsideration process\, TWC provided NHPD with written\nsubmissions\, additional scientific data and expert analysis regarding its\nconclusions related to classification\, safety and efficacy. TWC requested that the\nreconsideration process be conducted by different officials than those involved\nin the original PLA assessment. NHPD gave TWC assurances throughout the process\nthat it had consulted individuals who were not involved in the original PLA\nprocess; however\, the judge questioned the independence of the experts retained\nby Health Canada in its review.\n[31]          \nOn April 7\, 2008\, the NHPD rendered its first decision\nin the reconsideration process\, responding to TWC__s requests for\nreconsideration related to both classification and safety and efficacy at once.\nNHPD maintained that Resolve did not meet the definition of a NHP. It found the\nadditional data submitted by TWC to support its position that the Active\nIngredient was naturally occurring was inconclusive. As a result\, safety and\nefficacy could only be addressed pursuant to an application under the Food\nand Drug Regulations.\n[32]          \nFive months after its initial refusal to\nreconsider\, on September 18\, 2008\, NHPD rendered a second refusal. On the basis\nof its review of additional information submitted by TWC\, it reversed its prior\ndecision on safety. However\, it maintained its position that there was insufficient\nevidence of efficacy as a smoking reduction/cessation aid. Despite abandoning\nits position that the product was not safe\, no change was made by Health Canada\nto the requirement that Resolve be recalled from the Canadian market. NHPD\nindicated that it would be willing to further reconsider its findings related\nto efficacy.\n[33]          \nNHPD rendered its __final__\nreconsideration decision regarding classification and efficacy on July 22\, 2009\,\nconcluding once again that the evidence was insufficient to classify Resolve as\na NHP. NHPD stated that it drew this conclusion on the basis of its review of\nall of the evidence that TWC had submitted throughout the licensing and\nreconsideration processes. Given its classification decision\, NHPD considered\nthe outstanding efficacy issue to be __moot__. Nonetheless\,\nNHPD confirmed its previous findings relating to the efficacy of Resolve. NHPD\ngave __final notice__ pursuant to subsection 10(2)\nof the Regulations that the product did not meet the definition of a NHP\nand that its conclusion on efficacy was final.\n[34]          \nThough the NHPD communicated to TWC that the\nJuly 22\, 2009 decision was final\, it subsequently accepted further submissions related\nto Resolve. Further additional reconsideration decisions were communicated to\nTWC on October 19\, 2009; September 20\, 2011; and January 30\, 2012. On January\n30\, 2012\, the NHPD stated that additional evidence had been considered\, but it\nmaintained its position on both classification and efficacy. The letter stated\nthat the refusal was final and the reconsideration process concluded.\nC.               \nThe Federal Court decision\n[35]          \nThe judicial review and reconsideration\nproceedings moved in parallel. As decisions were rendered in the\nreconsideration process\, the original judicial review application was amended.\nBut the proceedings were not separate __ independent laboratory reports and\nexpert opinions submitted in the reconsideration process were filed in the\njudicial review. The reconsideration process lasted four years\, the judicial\nreview\, much longer. The reconsideration process was poorly managed. There was\nno finality. Even Health Canada__s __final__\ndecision was not final in practice\, as it continued to receive\, review and\nrespond to further submissions. These\, as well as Health Canada__s responses\,\nall found their way into the court record. As will be seen\, this was not\nwithout consequence for the judicial review.\n[36]          \nIt is useful to recapitulate the key findings in\nthe Federal Court insofar as they underlie the judge__s legal analysis and bear\non the appropriateness of the remedy.\n(1)              \nClassification\n[37]          \nFirst\, from December 2\, 2004 to the August 21\, 2007\nAdjustment Letter\, the judge found that Health Canada had concluded\, on the\nbasis of its own criteria\, that Resolve was properly classified as a NHP. It\nhad confirmed that conclusion on more than one occasion between those dates. For\nexample\, the judge noted that the issue of classification was raised when Mr. Gustafson\,\nthe investigator assigned to the Pfizer complaint\, emailed Dr. Marles to\nchallenge the previous classification of Resolve. Dr. Marles responded to Mr.\nGustafson by confirming that the Active Ingredient was a NHP according to the\nDNP (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 75).\n[38]          \nThe judge found that\, based on the structure of\nthe Regulations\, the reliance on safety and efficacy concerns for the\nJuly NOR necessarily implied that NHPD did not consider classification to be at\nissue when it rendered its decision. Put otherwise\, if it were not a NHP\, the\nfindings on efficacy and safety would be immaterial given that those criteria\nwould have to be evaluated under the standards and methodologies governing drug\nsubmissions.\n[39]          \nThe judge found that\, even after the first\ndecision was made\, Dr. Marles made it clear by way of email on July 25\, 2007\nthat __everyone internally knows [the Active Ingredient]\nis an NHP__. Despite this correspondence\, Mr. Gustafson conducted his own\nresearch into the scientific articles relied upon by the DNP and raised the\nissue again with Dr. Marles\, who was now convinced that the classification of\nthe product should be questioned. The judge found that Dr. Marles directed that\nthe Adjustment Letter on classification be issued (Reasons for Judgment\, paras.\n75-77).\n[40]          \nIn October 2008\, TWC received a report by Dr.\nArnason\, an expert retained by Health Canada for the purposes of the judicial review.\nDr. Arnason opined that __there is no convincing\nevidence of [the Active Ingredient naturally occurring] that would be\nacceptable in a peer reviewed phytochemical journal__. Based on this\nreport\, the judge noted this to be evidence that the standards upon which\nResolve was evaluated as a NHP were __asserted __ and\nthen changed__ during the reconsideration process. Dr. Arnason__s evidence\nwas subsequently struck from the record as improper expert opinion.\n(2)              \nSafety and efficacy\n[41]          \nSafety was raised as an issue on May 4\, 2007\,\nwhen the first warning letter was issued to TWC. The letter attached a revised\nHHE which demonstrated that Resolve had been classified as a Type II Health\nHazard. By September 18\, 2008 safety had been conceded.\n[42]          \nThe judge noted that the efficacy and safety\nissues were intricately connected\, as they both formed part of the July NOR.\nThe lack of prior notice and deviation from standard practices were equally\nconcerning for the judge on the issue of efficacy (Reasons for Judgment\, paras.\n131-132).\n[43]          \nThe judge also took issue with NHPD__s interpretation\nof the efficacy requirements\, which seemed to demand __conclusive\nproof of efficacy in the form of unimpeachable human clinical studies__\n(Reasons for Judgment\, para. 132). The judge concluded that section 7 and\nsubsection 5(g) of the Regulations only require an applicant to provide\ninformation that reasonably supports some degree of efficacy as claimed in the\nPLA (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 142).\n[44]          \nTWC claimed in its PLA that Resolve __may__ help with smoking cessation\, and the judge found\nthat the information submitted supported such a claim. The judge determined\nthat the NHPD__s reading of the Regulations was both __incorrect as a matter of statutory interpretation and\nunreasonable in the full context of the manner in which efficacy was dealt\nwith__ (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 142).\n[45]          \nThe judge correctly noted the demarcation\nbetween the regulatory standards for the assessment of the safety and efficacy\nof drugs and the regulatory standards for the assessment of the safety and\nefficacy of NHPs. Subsection 5(g) of the Regulations requires __information that supports the safety and efficacy__ of\nNHPs in contrast with Regulation C.08.002(2) of the Food and Drug Regulations\nwhich requires that a submission for a Notice of Compliance for a new drug\ncontain:\n\n\n\n\n[__]\n\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n(f) details of the tests to be applied to control the potency\,\n  purity\, stability and safety of the new drug;\n\n\nf) le d_tail des _preuves qui doivent _tre effectu_es pour\n  contr_ler l__activit_\, la puret_\, la stabilit_ et l__innocuit_ de la drogue\n  nouvelle;\n\n\n\n\n(g) detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety of\n  the new drug for the purpose and under the conditions of use recommended;\n\n\ng) les rapports d_taill_s des _preuves effectu_es en vue d___tablir\n  l__innocuit_ de la drogue nouvelle\, aux fins et selon le mode d__emploi\n  recommand_s;\n\n\n\n\n(h) substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness of the new\n  drug for the purpose and under the conditions of use recommended;\n\n\nh) des preuves substantielles de l__efficacit_ clinique de la\n  drogue nouvelle aux fins et selon le mode d__emploi recommand_s;\n\n\n\n\n[__]\n\n\n__\n\n\n\n\n[46]          \nI also agree with the judge__s conclusion that\,\ngiven the breaches of procedural fairness\, the reconsideration process related\nto efficacy did not rectify the shortcomings of the PLA process (Reasons for\nJudgment\, para. 143).\n(3)              \nProcedural fairness / Bias\n[47]          \nAs noted\, the Attorney General has conceded that\nthere were breaches of procedural fairness plaguing this series of events.\nHowever\, I have summarised some of the key facts which underlie this concession\nas they inform the judge__s approach to remedy:\n              \ni.                  \nDr. Marles instigated removal of the Active\nIngredient by enlisting the support of the DNP in an effort to legitimize his\nunacceptable decision (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 82);\n            \nii.                  \nThe reconsideration process involved individuals\nresponsible for the Adjustment Letter\, despite assurances given to the contrary\n(Reasons for Judgment\, para. 91);\n          \niii.                  \nThe NHPD responded to TWC__s request for\nindependent experts with Drs. Arnason and Foster\, whose impartiality was called\ninto question (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 92);\n          \niv.                  \nThe NHPD did not conduct its own laboratory\ntesting\, as Dr. Marles admitted would have been necessary to refute the\nevidence provided by TWC__s experts (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 93);\n            \nv.                  \nThere was evidence sufficient to raise a concern\nthat Dr. Marles knew which expert opinions to secure in order to support his\nown conclusions and past decisions (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 93);\n          \nvi.                  \nThough Dr. Arnason stated that he conducted a\nliterature search of __one of the most authoritative\ndatabases__\, he did not find any articles confirming the natural\noccurrence of the Active Ingredient\, despite the existence of one such article\n(Reasons for Judgment\, para. 94); and\n        \nvii.                  \nThe final reconsideration decision of January\n30\, 2012\, which referenced the reports of Health Canada__s experts Drs. Arnason\nand Foster\, set out new allegations and arguments not previously disclosed to\nTWC and did not provide TWC with an opportunity to respond (Reasons for\nJudgment\, para. 95).\n[48]          \nThe judge also found a reasonable apprehension\nof bias arising from consideration of the safety of Resolve. For example\, he noted\nthat safety had been confirmed within Health Canada in June 2007 (Reasons for\nJudgment\, para. 99). This was in contradiction to the HHEs\, including HHE#6\,\nwhich contained new reasons supporting Resolve's designation as a Type II\nHealth Hazard that appeared to be unsupported by the evidence. TWC was given no\nopportunity to respond to these new allegations (Reasons for Judgment\, paras.\n98 and 108).\n[49]          \nThe judge noted in particular the statement made\nby Mr. Gustafson to a TWC representative to the effect that\, no matter the\ninformation provided by TWC\, a PLA was not going to be granted (Reasons for\nJudgment\, para. 109). I note however\, that this finding was challenged as\nhearsay. In fact\, TWC had provided Health Canada with an expert report\nconfirming its safety in July 2007\, prior to the issuance of the July NOR\n(Reasons for Judgment\, para. 106).\n[50]          \nThe judge detailed further Dr. Marles__\ninvolvement in the PLA process. He noted that\, before his intervention\, an\nofficial within the Bureau of Product Review and Assessment (BPRA) within NHPD\nhad confirmed that the product was safe. The judge found that BPRA took Dr.\nMarles__ concerns at face value without conducting its own review or analysis\,\nand allowed Dr. Marles to direct that the initial Safety and Efficacy\nAssessment Report be set aside and replaced by an assessment taking greater\naccount of his safety concerns (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 119). The judge\nconcluded that Dr. Marles influenced BPRA to deviate from its standard\nlicensing practices (Reasons for Judgment\, para. 121).\n[51]          \nThe judge concluded that Dr. Marles__\norchestration of the Adjustment Letter and his influence in the reconsideration\nprocess in particular led to a reasonable apprehension of bias in accordance\nwith the test laid out in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193\, at paras. 45-47 (Reasons\nfor Judgment\, para. 96).\n(4)              \nEvidentiary issues\n[52]          \nWhat began as a discrete judicial review of the\nJuly NOR metamorphasized into a six-year inquiry into the merits of the licence\napplication\, with the applicant and respondent before him filing competing",healthTax Court of Canada Judgments,Bishoff v.

They want\n      enhanced access and choice to a full range of natural health\n      products\, along with an assurance of safety and quality.\n\nIn 1997\, Health Canada responded to these concerns by\n      establishing an advisory panel to provide direction and advice.\n      In November 1997\, Health Minister Allan Rock asked the Standing\n      Committee on Health to conduct a full public review and provide\n      recommendations on the regulation of natural health products.\n\nThe establishment of the Office of Natural Health Products\n      (ONHP) is based on the 53 recommendations contained in the\n      Standing Committee on Health's report ""Natural Health\n      Products: A New Vision"". The recommendations respond to the\n      concerns of Canadian consumers\, health care providers and\n      industry. They call for a new Office and regulatory framework for\n      natural health products to be set up within Health Canada.\n\nOn March 26\, 1999\, Health Minister Allan Rock accepted the\n      recommendations of the Standing Committee. In announcing the\n      establishment of the Office of Natural Health Products\, he set a\n      new course for the way natural health products will be regulated\n      in Canada.\n\n""The creation of the new Office of Natural Health\n      Products is a major step forward for consumers\,"" Mr. Rock\n      said. ""For the first time\, there will be a dedicated group\n      of professional experts who will treat the evaluation of health\n      products with the distinctiveness and flexibility it\n      deserves.""\n\nHe added that the new Office will provide Canadian consumers\n      with the assurance of safety while enhancing consumer access and\n      choice to a full range of natural health products.\n\nIn this and subsequent statements\, the Minister also set in\n      motion the elements needed to bring about a fresh approach to the\n      regulation of such products. $7 million is being allocated over\n      the next 3 years to establish the new Office. An additional $3\n      million over 3 years will be allocated to fund natural health\n      product research.\n\nThe Office will be a new regulatory authority\, separate from\n      the Therapeutic Products Programme and Food Directorate\,\n      reporting to the Assistant Deputy Minister\, Health Protection\n      Branch. It will be staffed with a small core of those with\n      expertise and experience in natural health products. It will draw\n      further expertise from an Expert Advisory Committee and other\n      external groups in order to develop and maintain a new regulatory\n      framework.\n\nHealth Canada will consult regularly with Canadians as the new\n      Office moves to implement the recommendations of the\n      Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health. Natural health\n      products will continue to be regulated either as foods or drugs\n      until the new regulatory framework is established.\n\n\n      [7]            \n      The agent for the Appellant also refers to Interpretation\n      Bulletin IT-519R2\, which states among other things that a\n      ""medical practitioner"" encompasses a broad range of\n      individuals in a medical profession and refers to\n      paragraph 4 of the Bulletin\, which reads as follows:\n\n\n      4.              \n      For purposes of the medical expense and disability tax credits\n      under sections 118.2 and 118.3\, subsection 118.4(2)\n      provides that a reference to a medical practitioner\, dentist\,\n      pharmacist\, nurse or optometrist means a person who is authorized\n      to practice as such according to the following laws: ...\n\n\n      (b)            \n      for a certificate issued for an individual\, the laws of the\n      jurisdiction in which the individual resides or of a province;\n      and\n\n...\n\nMedical practitioners authorized to practice in accordance\n      with the above laws can include (depending on the applicable\n      province or jurisdiction\, as the case may be) the following:\n\n...\n\n(iii)            a\n      naturopath;\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n      [8]            \n      Paragraph 118.2(2)(n) of the Act provides that only\n      expenses incurred for drugs\, medicaments and other preparations\n      or substances purchased for use by the patient as prescribed by a\n      medical practitioner and as recorded by a pharmacist can be\n      claimed.\n\n\n      [9]            \n      Counsel for the Respondent submits that firstly Dr. Zanoaga does\n      not qualify as a medical practitioner under the laws of the\n      province of Alberta. In this regard he refers to the Health\n      Disciplines Act R.S.A. 1980 c. H-3.5 and the schedule thereto\n      which enumerates the Designated Health Disciplines. Counsel\n      points out that none of the disciplines refer to a herbalist or\n      iridologist\, which are the qualifications of Dr. Zanoaga. He\n      states further that the jurisdiction in question is Alberta and\n      that the Act and Schedule apply and since Dr.\n      Zanoaga is not listed in the designated disciplines and further\n      since she possesses no licence from the province of Alberta to\n      practice (although she does have a business licence from the City\n      of Edmonton) for that reason alone the Appellant cannot succeed.\n      He adds that since the vitamins\, herbs and other things that the\n      Appellant took were not recorded by a pharmacist\, for that reason\n      also the Appellant cannot succeed.\n\n[10]           Counsel\n      for the Respondent also referred to several decisions including\n      Banman v. Canada\, [2001] T.C.J. No. 111 (T.C.C.) where\n      Bowman\, T.C.J.\, as he then was\, stated:\n\n\n      4.              \n      I have great sympathy for the appellant. I think she has very\n      intelligently gone to an alternative method of treatment and has\n      successfully treated medical conditions of her husband\, herself\n      and her daughter. Nonetheless\, the herbal preparations\, the\n      vitamins and other things that she takes that she purchases from\n      Natural Lifestyle are not prescribed by a medical practitioner or\n      dentist and are not recorded by a pharmacist. That is the key\n      condition and unfortunately it is not met. I have to take the law\n      as I find it. I would like to be able to help them\, but I merely\n      interpret the law. Counsel referred me to a couple of cases.\n      Mongillo v. The Queen\, 95 D.T.C. 199\, and\n      Williams v. R.\, [1998] 1 C.T.C. 2813.\n\n[11]           I echo\n      the above comments of Bowman\, T.C.J. Regrettably\, for the reasons\n      set forth in Banman\, the Appellant in this appeal cannot\n      succeed. Firstly\, it has not been established that Dr. Zanoaga is\n      a medical practitioner within the definitions discussed above and\n      moreover it is clear that the items purchased were not recorded\n      by a pharmacist.\n\n[12]           The law\n      may well change in the future to give further recognition to\n      natural health products such as herbal products\, vitamins and\n      mineral supplements and other homeopathic preparations but I am\n      obliged to enforce the law as it existed in 1998. Consequently\n      the appeal must be dismissed. I would add that on the issue of\n      interest\, this Court has no jurisdiction to alter the interest\n      charged and consequently the appeal on that issue must also be\n      dismissed. There shall be no costs.\n\n\n                       \n      Signed at Ottawa\, Canada\, this 6th day of September\, 2001.\n\n\n""T.

Athoe [hereinafter\, the ""immigration officer""] of the Canadian Consulate General in Buffalo\, New York\, dated June 10\, 1996\, in which the applicant's application for permanent residence [hereinafter\, the ""AFL""] was rejected.\n[2]      The applicant seeks to have his AFL re-opened and referred to a different visa officer for re-determination; a determination of whether or not it would be lawful to grant a visa for permanent status to the applicant and his dependants; and requests that the respondent not remove the applicant and his dependants from Canada pending the final determination of this application for judicial review.\nTHE FACTS\n[3]      On July 28\, 1994\, the applicant submitted his AFL to the Canadian Consulate in Buffalo. The applicant listed his spouse and three daughters\, Alison\, Elizabeth and Diana as his four dependants. The applicant and his wife are stateless and his three daughters are all British Dependant Territories citizens. In box #27 of his AFL\, the applicant noted that neither he nor any of his dependants have ever had any serious disease or physical or mental disorder.\n[4]      According to the immigration officer's affidavit\, the applicant and his wife are currently living in Canada with visitor's permits valid until September\, 1996.\n[5]      On November 2\, 1994\, the immigration officer interviewed the applicant over the telephone and inquired as to why the applicant had been refused an immigrant visa in 1989. The applicant informed the immigration officer that his 1989 application had been rejected due to the medical inadmissibility of a fourth - his eldest - daughter. In early 1990\, this daughter had been determined to be an ""M7"" case\, that is\, a case of the highest degree of medical inadmissibility. At the time of the telephone interview\, this daughter was attending school in Canada. This daughter was not listed in the applicant's current AFL as a dependant.\n[6]      The immigration officer conducted a personal interview with the applicant and his wife on January 9\, 1995. The immigration officer discussed with the applicant the issue of the fourth daughter\, whose name is Kwai Wing Alice Law [hereinafter\, ""Alice""]. Alice was born on July 3\, 1974. The applicant advised that Alice was currently attending a school for impaired children in Canada because she was ""slow."" He further advised that he had continuously financially supported Alice\, and that she had always been a student. On this basis\, the immigration officer concluded that Alice was a dependant\, and added in Alice's name on the applicant's AFL. After the conclusion of the interview\, the immigration officer decided to await the results of a new medical assessment of Alice before continuing to process the applicant's AFL.\n[7]      On May 10\, 1995\, the immigration office in Buffalo sent the applicant a letter advising that the AFL was still under consideration. However\, if the requested medical examination results were not received within the next three months\, it would be assumed that the applicant was no longer interested in pursuing the AFL\, and his file would be ""closed.""\n[8]      On June 20\, 1995\, the immigration officer sent a letter to the applicant's then solicitor\, advising\, amongst other concerns\, that ""[n]o decision in this case will be made until the above dependant [Alice] has completed the requirements.""\n[9]      The immigration officer deposes that although she heard no further reply from the applicant\, she noted that the computer system showed that Alice had been directed by Health Programs to undergo further medical tests in September of 1995. Counsel to the applicant has tendered into evidence a letter\, dated July 25\, 1995\, which he wrote to the immigration officer in response to her June 20 letter\, in which he confirmed that Alice had undergone a medical examination with a designated medical practitioner.\n[10]      On April 30\, 1996\, the immigration officer received confirmation from the Health Programs office that\, although additional medical information from the applicant had been requested\, there was no reply to date.\n[11]      By letter dated June 10\, 1996\, the immigration officer advised the applicant that his AFL had been refused because he had not complied with the requirement to complete the medical examination of his dependant daughter\, Alice.\nDISCUSSION\nThe statutory requirements\n[12]      Persons wishing to immigrate to Canada can be granted landed immigrant status if they are not members of any inadmissible class\, and if they otherwise meet the requirements of the Immigration Act and the Regulations. The onus is on the immigrant to establish admissibility and statutory compliance.\n[13]      Subsection 9(3) of the Immigration Act provides:\n\n \n      (3)      Every person shall answer truthfully all question put to that person by a visa officer and shall produce such documentation as may be required by the visa officer for the purpose of establishing that his admission would not be contrary to this Act or the regulations.\n          \n\n \n                                  [emphasis added]\n[14]      In the course of examining the prospective immigrant\, a designated medical officer must form an opinion\, pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(a) of the Immigration Act\, as to whether\, as a result of the immigrant's health and medical condition\, the admission of the immigrant into Canada would cause\, or might reasonably be expected to cause\, excessive demands on Canadian health and social services due to the nature\, severity and probable duration of any identified medical or health condition.\nAnalysis\n[15]      The immigration officer requested such a medical opinion in respect of the applicant's dependant daughter\, Alice. The applicant was warned\, in writing\, that his file would be ""closed"" if this request were not complied with within three months. One month later\, the applicant's solicitor was advised that no decision in the applicant's case would be made until the information regarding Alice was submitted. A month after that\, the applicant's solicitor advised the immigration officer that Alice had undergone a medical assessment\, identifying the examining physician. The immigration officer's decision to reject the applicant's AFL came over one year after the initial\, written request for the medical information. The reason for rejection was that the applicant\, by not supplying the requested information\, had not complied with subsection 9(3) of the Immigration Act\, and was thus a member of the inadmissible class of persons described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the Immigration Act. The applicant was then advised that he could re-apply in the future by submitting a new AFL\, and paying the processing fees once more.\n[16]      The respondent submits that the applicant was not denied procedural fairness because the applicant had ample and repeated notice that his application would be rejected should he fail to produce the requested medical documentation\, and that the applicant alone must accept responsibility for the consequences of his own failure to act in a diligent manner.\n[17]      The evidence seems to indicate otherwise. In the May 10\, 1995 letter\, the immigration officer advised the applicant that his file would be ""closed"" if the requested information was not provided. I am not sure of what exactly is meant by ""closing"" a file. I believe that this term can imply rejection. However\, in the context of processing an AFL\, precise terms should be used in order to avoid the possibility of confusion and misunderstanding. Confusion is further created in this case through the immigration officer's letter to the applicant's counsel\, dated June 20\, 1995\, which states that ""[n]o decision in this case will be made until the above dependent has completed the requirements."" Rather than suggesting rejection if a dead-line is not met\, this letter seems to imply the opposite. This letter seems to imply that the processing of the AFL will continue until the requested information is received. A reading of the language of the letter\, in its plain and ordinary grammatical form\, cannot indicate otherwise.\n[18]      Submissions from both counsel to the applicant and counsel to the respondent are as sparse as they are weak. No case law directly on point has been cited.\nCONCLUSION\n[19]      It is certainly natural for the applicant to assume\, under the circumstances\, when his dependant daughter is called in for\, and attends\, a medical examination\, that he has no personal requirements beyond that\, even if the requirements of the Immigration Act are otherwise. I see little in the official correspondence that could have warned him of the consequences that ultimately ensued. In this case\, the requirements of procedural fairness have not been met.\n[20]      Nevertheless\, no matter who is at fault in this particular case\, the applicant's dependant daughter cannot become exempt from medical admissibility requirements as stipulated in the Immigration Act. Therefore\, the decision under attack is set aside and the applicant's AFL may be re-opened for processing by a different immigration officer. I further direct that all the necessary medical information be provided to the immigration officer\, including that from any further medical examinations that may have to be arranged\, within six months of this decision. This should give the applicant ample time to complete the application in respect of Alice\, and the visa officer will have a complete file upon which he or she can make a decision.\n[21]      Accordingly\, this application for judicial review is allowed.\n                          ""James A.

Because Transport Canada took the\nposition that it had no authority to investigate such a complaint\, CUPE says\nthat Transport Canada has misconstrued its jurisdiction and fettered its\ndiscretion.\n \n[3]              \nAir\nCanada says\, in\nreply\, that Transport Canada has no residual authority to conduct a safety\ninvestigation or to order remedial action under s. 145 of the Code until the\ninternal complaint resolution requirements of the Code have run their course. \nIn the result Air Canada says that Transport Canada's decision was\ncorrect.\n \na.                 \nBackground\n[4]              \nOn\nNovember 24\, 2007 an Air Canada flight attendant (the employee) refused to work\naboard an aircraft scheduled to depart from Vancouver.  The\nemployee believed that an inoperable cabin communication system created a\ndangerous work environment which justified a refusal to work under ss. 128(1)\nof the Code.  The aircraft in question was withdrawn from service and\,\neventually\, another aircraft was substituted.\n \n[5]              \nThe\nevidentiary Record indicates that the internal complaint resolution process was\nengaged by the employee as contemplated by s. 127.1 of the Code.  Although the\nemployee expressed concern that the protocol for dealing with such situations\nwas not strictly followed\, there is nothing to indicate that her safety concern\nwas dismissed by Air Canada\, which effectively accepted the validity\nof her complaint when it withdrew the aircraft from service.  There is also nothing\nin the Record establishing that the employee was penalized for the position she\ntook beyond the fact that the cabin crew were not re-assigned that day to\nanother flight and were instead deadheaded on the next available flight home.\n \n[6]              \nOn\nNovember 25\, 2007 the employee made a written complaint to the Air Canada Health\nand Safety Committee in Winnipeg.  That complaint took\nissue with several alleged lapses in the safety protocol and with the delay at\nthe time in resolving her concern.  She also complained about rude and abrupt behaviour\nby the Captain and maintenance crew and sought an assurance that she would\nreceive full pay for her shift.  There is nothing before me to indicate what\,\nif anything\, was done by the Health and Safety Committee to address the\nemployee__s complaint.  But the affidavit of the employer co-chair of that\nCommittee and the employee__s supervisor\, Patty Whitehall\, deposes that she was\nin the process of carrying out an investigation of the complaint when\, on\nDecember 21\, 2007\, CUPE registered a complaint with Transport Canada seeking\nthe involvement of a Health and Safety Officer.  That complaint attached the\nemployee__s initial complaint\, and further alleged violations of ss. 128(10)\nand 128(13) of the Code concerning the protocol for addressing an employee__s refusal\nto work.  CUPE__s complaint also indicated that the internal complaint\nresolution process was __not applicable__. The reference in this complaint to ss.\n128(13) of the Code appears to have been an attempt by CUPE to involve a Health\nand Safety Officer immediately on the basis of a supposed ongoing dispute with\nAir Canada over the employee's refusal to work.  \n \n[7]              \nOn\nJanuary 2\, 2008 Transport Canada responded to the CUPE complaint by\nstating:\nThis will acknowledge receipt\nof your complaint against Air Canada dated November 25\, 2007\,\nwhich was received in this office on December 21\, 2007.\n \nA Health and Safety Officer does not have\nthe authority to investigate a complaint prior to completion of the Internal\nComplaint Resolution Process as stated in section 127.1 of the Canada Labour\nCode Part II.  As a result\, the above-mentioned complaint has been returned to\nyou for proper handling.\n \n \n[8]              \nIt\nis the correctness of this decision that is in issue in this application and\,\nin particular\, whether the completion of the internal complaint resolution\nprocess is a necessary prerequisite to the initiation of a Health and Safety\nOfficer investigation under s. 127.1 of the Code.\n \nII.        Issues\n[9]              \nDid\nthe decision by Transport Canada not to investigate CUPE__s complaint\nconstitute a jurisdictional error or a fettering of jurisdiction?\n \nIII.       Analysis\n[10]          \nThe\nparties agree\, as do I\, that the standard of review for a jurisdictional issue\nof the sort raised here is correctness: see Dunsmuir v. New\n Brunswick\,\n2008 SCC 9\, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 at para. 59.\n \n[11]          \nIt\nis clear from the Record that the employee__s initial safety concern arose under\nthe refusal to work provisions in s. 128 of the Code.  The formal complaint to\nthe employer as later conveyed to Transport Canada was made\,\nhowever\, under s. 127.1 dealing with alleged contraventions of Part II of\nthe Code.  That provision stipulates very clearly that all such matters must be\nsubmitted initially to the internal complaint resolution process before other\navailable recourse is sought.  The s. 127.1 internal process contemplates\nthe immediate referral of a complaint to the employee__s supervisor.  If\nresolution at that level is unsuccessful either the employee or the supervisor\nis entitled to refer the matter for a joint health and safety investigation\nfrom which a written report is required.  If the investigators conclude that a\ndangerous condition continues to exist\, the employer is required to protect all\nat-risk employees until the danger has been rectified.  The Code contemplates\nthe involvement of a Health and Safety Officer only at the point where a safety\ncomplaint has not been resolved by the joint internal investigation to the\nsatisfaction of either the employee or the employer.  The provisions in s.\n127.1 that contemplate the involvement of a Health and Safety Officer in the complaint\nresolution process are ss. 127.1(8)\, 127.1(9)\, 127.1(10) and 127.1(11) which\nstate:\n\n\n\n\n127.1\n  (8) The employee or employer may refer a complaint that there has been a\n  contravention of this Part to a health and safety officer in the following\n  circumstances: \n \n \n \n(a) where the employer does not agree\n  with the results of the investigation;\n \n(b) where the employer has failed to\n  inform the persons who investigated the complaint of how and when the\n  employer intends to resolve the matter or has failed to take action to\n  resolve the matter; or\n\n\n\n(c) where the persons who investigated\n  the complaint do not agree between themselves as to whether the complaint is\n  justified.\n \nInvestigation\n  by health and safety officer\n \n(9)\n  The health and safety officer shall investigate\, or cause another health and\n  safety officer to investigate\, the complaint referred to the officer under\n  subsection (8). \n \nDuty\n  and power of health and safety officer\n \n(10)\n  On completion of the investigation\, the health and safety officer \n \n(a) may issue directions to an employer\n  or employee under subsection 145(1);\n \n(b) may\, if in the officer__s opinion it\n  is appropriate\, recommend that the employee and employer resolve the matter\n  between themselves; or\n \n(c) shall\, if the officer concludes\n  that a danger exists as described in subsection 128(1)\, issue directions\n  under subsection 145(2).\n \n \n \n \nInterpretation\n \n(11)\n  For greater certainty\, nothing in this section limits a health and safety\n  officer__s authority under section 145.\n \n\n\n127.1\n  (8) La plainte fond_e sur l__existence d__une situation constituant une\n  contravention _ la pr_sente partie peut _tre renvoy_e par l__employeur ou\n  l__employ_ _ l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ dans les cas suivants : \n \na) l__employeur conteste les r_sultats\n  de l__enqu_te;\n \n \nb) l__employeur a omis de prendre les\n  mesures n_cessaires pour rem_dier _ la situation faisant l__objet de la\n  plainte dans les d_lais pr_vus ou d__en informer les personnes charg_es de\n  l__enqu_te;\n\n\n\nc) les personnes charg_es de l__enqu_te\n  ne s__entendent pas sur le bien-fond_ de la plainte.\n \n \n \nEnqu_te\n \n \n(9)\n  L__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ saisi de la plainte fait enqu_te sur celle-ci\n  ou charge un autre agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ de le faire _ sa place. \n \n \nPouvoirs\n  de l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_\n \n(10)\n  Au terme de l__enqu_te\, l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ : \n \n \na) peut donner _ l__employeur ou _\n  l__employ_ toute instruction pr_vue au paragraphe 145(1);\n \nb) peut\, s__il l__estime opportun\,\n  recommander que l__employeur et l__employ_ r_glent _ l__amiable la situation\n  faisant l__objet de la plainte;\n \nc) s__il conclut _ l__existence de l__une\n  ou l__autre des situations mentionn_es au paragraphe 128(1)\, donne des\n  instructions en conformit_ avec le paragraphe 145(2).\n \nPr_cision\n \n(11)\n  Il est entendu que les dispositions du pr_sent article ne portent pas\n  atteinte aux pouvoirs conf_r_s _ l__agent de sant_ et de s_curit_ sous le\n  r_gime de l__article 145.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n[12]          \nCUPE\ncontends that ss. 127.1(11)\, above\, recognizes an overarching authority by a\nHealth and Safety Officer to consider a complaint brought under s. 127.1 at any\npoint in the process and to order\, where appropriate\, immediate remediation\nunder s. 145.  CUPE says that the failure by Transport Canada to recognize this\naspect of its residual jurisdiction represents a fettering of its\njurisdiction.  Presumably CUPE would not have been troubled if Transport Canada had said instead that\,\nnotwithstanding its right to intervene\, it was declining to do so until all\ninternal settlement processes had been exhausted.  \n \n[13]          \nAdmittedly\nss. 127.1(11) is badly written and it completely fails to meet its stated\nobjective of providing __greater certainty__.  I do not agree with CUPE\, though\,\nthat this provision was intended to recognize an authority under s. 145 for\ninvolving a Health and Safety Officer in the resolution of a s. 127.1\ncomplaint before the exhaustion of the stipulated internal processes.  The\nremedial authority conferred upon a Health and Safety Officer under s. 127.1 is\nfound in ss. 127.1(10).  The powers conferred upon a Health and Safety Officer\nunder s. 145 extend well beyond the scope of those recognized in ss. 127.1(10)\nsuch that the likely purpose of ss. 127.1(11) was to incorporate by general\nreference those additional s. 145 powers.  While there was undoubtedly a\nsimpler method for accomplishing this drafting objective\, the possibility of\nsimple redundancy cannot be ruled out given that this part of the Code is\nreplete with unnecessary verbiage\, poor drafting and a lack of clarity. In any\nevent\, I do not think that the combined reading of ss. 127.1(11) and s. 145 is\nsufficient to overcome the obvious intent of s. 127.1 that complaints of this\ntype must be fully considered internally before the involvement of Transport\nCanada can be obtained.  \n \n[14]          \nThe\ninternal complaint resolution provisions of the Code create a succession of\nsteps for resolving an employee safety complaint beginning with an informal\ndiscussion and ending with a referral to a Health and Safety Officer.  Much of\nthe applicable language of s. 127.1 is mandatory.  For instance\, ss. 127.1(1)\nrequires that a complaint be directed to the employee__s supervisor before any\nother available recourse is sought.  Under ss. 127.1(8) an employee or employer\nmay refer a complaint to a Health and Safety Officer if any one of the following\nthree preconditions is met:\n\n\n\n\n(a) where the\n  employer does not agree with the results of the investigation;\n \n(b) where the\n  employer has failed to inform the persons who investigated the complaint of\n  how and when the employer intends to resolve the matter or has failed to take\n  action to resolve the matter; or\n \n(c) where the\n  persons who investigated the complaint do not agree between themselves as to\n  whether the complaint is justified.\n \n\n\na)\n  l__employeur conteste les r_sultats de l__enqu_te;\n \n \nb)\n  l__employeur a omis de prendre les mesures n_cessaires pour rem_dier _ la\n  situation faisant l__objet de la plainte dans les d_lais pr_vus ou d__en\n  informer les personnes charg_es de l__enqu_te;\n \nc)\n  les personnes charg_es de l__enqu_te ne s__entendent pas sur le bien-fond_ de\n  la plainte.\n\n\n\n\n \nThese conditions clearly contemplate an internal\ninvestigation by the appropriate health and safety representatives before the\nengagement of Transport Canada.  It is only where the\ninternal investigation has been frustrated by employer inaction or by\ndisagreement that a Health and Safety Officer can be invited to intervene.  The\nobvious intent of these provisions is to allow the parties to pursue a mutually\nagreeable solution before seeking outside involvement and to provide the Health\nand Safety Officer with the benefit of a written investigation report or\, in\nthe case of disagreement\, two reports.  In Re Caponi\, [2002] C.I.R.B.\nNo. 177 at para. 24 the Canadian Industrial Relations Board held that s. 127.1\n__sets out a binding internal settlement process__ which must be followed before\nPart II remedies are available.  I agree with that view.  \n \n[15]          \nI do\nnot agree with CUPE that s. 145 of the Code was intended to create a separate\nbasis for the involvement of a Health and Safety Officer in the resolution of\ncomplaints brought forward under s. 127.1.  Section 145 is a remedial provision\nwhich is only engaged where a Health and Safety Officer is carrying out an\ninvestigation authorized by some other provision in the Code.  This was the\nview of Justice Richard in Gilmore v. Canadian National Railway\, [1995]\nF.C.J. No. 1601\, 104 F.T.R. 74\,[1]\nwhere he held at paras. 7 to 9:\n7    \nCounsel for the applicant relied heavily on the wording of subsection 145(1) of\nPart II of the Code which reads:\n \nDirection\nto terminate contraventions\n145.\n(1) Where a safety officer is of the opinion that any provision of this Part is\nbeing contravened\, the officer may direct the employer or employee concerned to\nterminate the contravention within such time as the officer may specify and the\nofficer shall\, if requested by the employer or employee concerned\, confirm the\ndirection in writing if the direction was given orally. (my underlining)\n \n8    \nIn my view\, this subsection\, which provides for oral directions\, can only\nrelate to contraventions which the safety officer is otherwise authorized to\nconduct and about which he or she is empowered to make decisions under Part II\nof the Code6.\n \n9    \nThe roles of the Board and of the safety officer are separate and distinct. The\nonly legislated exception is in respect of matters provided in subsection\n129(5) where the Board may review a decision of the safety officer. Pursuant to\nsection 134\, the Board has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with contraventions\nof paragraph 147(a) of the Code (disciplinary measures). Nowhere in Part II of\nthe Code is the safety officer given the remedial power to deal with\ndisciplinary measures taken by the employer by reason of the employee's\nexercise of his or her rights under that Part. The record shows that the\napplicant herein made a complaint to the Board\, but that it was judged by the\nBoard to be out of time by reason of the provisions of subsection 133(2) of the\nCode. Subsection 145(1) does not provide the employee with an alternative\nrecourse to a safety officer in such cases.\n \n[Emphasis added.]\n \n \nI do not agree with CUPE that the Federal\nCourt of Appeal decision in Martin v. Canada (Attorney General)\, 2005\nFCA 156\, [2005] F.C.J. No. 752 effectively reverses the holding in Gilmore.  In Martin\,\nthe question of the scope of s. 145 of the Code was not squarely in issue and\,\nin any event\, the Court at para. 29 found the substantive source of the\nOfficer__s authority to be in s. 124 and not in s. 145.  \n \n[16]          \nI\nam satisfied that where an employee initiates a complaint under s. 127.1 of the\nCode it is necessary to exhaust the internal complaint resolution process\nbefore the employee\, or the union on the employee__s behalf\, can request an\ninvestigation by a Health and Safety Officer.  That is not to say\, though\, that\ns. 127.1 of the Code contains the only authority for the initiation of an\ninvestigation by a Health and Safety Officer.  Sections 128 and 129 allow for\nsuch an investigation where an employee has refused dangerous work and where\nthe employer challenges that refusal.  Had Air Canada not acquiesced\nto the employee__s complaint in this case by grounding the aircraft in question\,\nthere can be little doubt that a Health and Safety Officer would have been\nrequired by ss. 129(1) to investigate the matter without delay.  \n \n[17]          \nAir\nCanada took the\nposition before me that\, outside of the scope of the refusal to work provisions\nand s. 141\, there is no residual authority vested in a Health and Safety\nOfficer to investigate a workplace safety concern raised by an employee.  Indeed\,\nAir Canada submitted in\nits Brief that __s. 127.1 has restricted the Safety Officer__s discretionary\ninvestigation powers under s. 141__.  While there may be very few employee\nsafety concerns that would not fall within the ambit of those provisions\, I\nfind it difficult to accept that a Health and Safety Officer confronted with an\nunresolved workplace hazard could not immediately order its remediation under\nss. 145(1) or 145(2) of the Code.  In many if not most cases of that type\nthe authority to intervene can be found in ss. 128(13).  But\, as pointed out by\nMr. Robbins\, that provision contains a notable gap where the employee__s\nconcern relates to a dangerous __condition__ involving another employee.  There\nthe complainant has no right to refuse to work and\, where the employer fails to\nact\, that provision does not authorize a Health and Safety Officer to\nintervene.  In a situation of an imminent ongoing risk and a recalcitrant\nemployer\, the protection afforded by s. 127.1 would provide scant comfort but\npresumably the right of a Health and Safety Officer to conduct a workplace\ninvestigation under s. 141 and to order remediation under s. 145 are\nsufficient to address this apparent regulatory limitation.  It follows that I\ndo not accept Air Canada__s argument that a workplace investigation carried\nout under s. 141 of the Code is necessarily restricted by the internal\ncomplaint resolution provisions.  Transport Canada can initiate\na s. 141 investigation as of right and it is not required to wait for an\nemployee complaint or its internal resolution before exercising that authority.\n\n \n[18]          \nIn\nthis case it is unnecessary to precisely define the limits of Transport Canada__s statutory\nauthority and in the absence of any argument from that agency\, it would not be\nprudent to do so.  It is sufficient to say that for a complaint of this sort\nwhich does not involve a situation of ongoing danger or an investigation under\ns. 141\, the internal complaint resolution process must be exhausted before\nrecourse to a Health and Safety Officer is available under ss. 127.1(8) of the\nCode.  I do not read Transport Canada__s letter of January 2\, 2008 as saying\nanything more than that and\, therefore\, its decision not to get involved was\nlegally correct.\n \n[19]          \nI\nwould only add that I agree with Air Canada that evidence of more\nexpansive investigatory practices in the past by Transport Canada cannot\nconfer upon it a more generous authority than it expressly enjoys under the\nCode.  \n \nIV.       Conclusion\n[20]          \nThis\napplication is dismissed with costs payable to Air Canada.  I will\naccept further Briefs (not exceeding 5 pages) from the parties within 7 days of\nthe date of this Judgment with respect to the quantification of costs.\n \n\n\n \nJUDGMENT\n \n            THIS COURT ADJUDGES that this application is dismissed with costs payable to Air Canada.

Introduction\n[2]              \nThis Court\nhas already determined that where the Immigration Division does not order continued\ndetention of a person because it erroneously believes that the person is\nalready detained\, the order must be quashed:\n[12]      In my view\, I need not deal\nwith the interpretation of section 128 of the CCRA.  It is clear that the\ntribunal member did not order continued detention because he was of the view\nthat the respondent would be detained in a federal penitentiary in any event. \nThat was not the case.  In arriving at his finding\, the tribunal member ignored\nthe initial approval of the respondent__s day parole.  He ignored the January\n25\, 2003 day parole eligibility document.  He chose to ignore the evidence as\nto the manner in which CSC approached the issue of day parole for those\nsentenced prior to June 28\, 2002.  He ignored the contents of the case\nmanagement bulletin that was before him.  He ignored the fact that\, despite his\nown views as to the interpretation of section 128 of the CCRA\, the respondent\nwould be day paroled on January 25th.  He erroneously concluded that the\nrespondent would be detained by CSC despite the overwhelming evidence to the\ncontrary that was before him.  \n \n[13]      Having reached this erroneous\nfinding of fact\, the tribunal member then based his decision upon it.  I\nconclude that the finding was patently unreasonable and was made in a perverse\nor capricious manner.  The finding taints the decision.  I therefore allowed\nthe application for judicial review and remitted the matter back for\nredetermination before a different member of the Immigration Division of the\nImmigration and Refugee Board by order dated July 8\, 2003.                                                                                                                             \n(Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\nv. Ambrose\,\n2003 FC 865\, 124 A.C.W.S. (3d) 757\, by Madam Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson)\n \n[3]              \nIt is recognized\nthat new evidence that was not before a tribunal or court cannot be used in a\njudicial review of a decision of the tribunal or court in question:\n \n[15]      In\nmy respectful view\, the same principle is applicable in this Court. The\nessential purpose of judicial review is the review of decisions\, not the\ndetermination\, by trial de novo\, of questions that were not adequately\ncanvassed in evidence at the tribunal or trial court. The latter is what the\napplicant is inappropriately proposing for this judicial review. This is not\nthe necessity to which Lord Sumner was referring in Nat Bell Liquors\, supra.\nThe Court will not entertain new evidence in these circumstances.\n \n \n(Gitxsan Treaty Society v. Hospital Employees Union\,\n[2000] 1 F.C. 135 (F.C.A.)\, [1999] F.C.J.\nNo. 1192 (QL).)\n \n[4]              \nIn Basha\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999)\, 86 A.C.W.S. (3d) 394\,\n[1999] F.C.J. No. 207 (QL)\, Mr. Justice Jean-Eudes Dub_ set out the principle\nas follows:\n \n[2]        The Order in question of\nMcGillis J. is the standard order used by the Court when granting leave to\ncommence an application for judicial review. It does not mean\, of course\, that\nany and all affidavits may be served and filed by either the applicant or the\nrespondent. The affidavits must be relevant and must not be used by the\napplicant for the purpose of introducing into the record evidence which was not\nbefore the tribunal when it rendered its decision. And the affidavits may not\nrelate to events which took place in the country of origin\, or elsewhere\, after\nthe hearing by the board. Nadon J. of this Court explained in a nutshell the\nrationale for that basic principle in Asafov c. M.E.I.\, (IMM-7425-93)\ndated May 18\, 1994\n \nThe purpose of the judicial\nreview process is to examine the tribunal's decision in the light of the\nevidence adduced before it at the hearing and to decide whether or not there\nare grounds for review. From that perspective\, the evidence which the\nApplicants now seek to introduce is irrelevant. By granting this application\, I\nwould be transforming the judicial review process into that of an appeal.\n \n(Also\, Asafov v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\n(1994)\, 48 A.C.W.S. (3d) 623\, [1994] F.C.J.\nNo. 713 (QL); Zolotareva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2003 F.C. 1274\, 241\n F.T.R. 289; Naredo\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1997] 3 F.C. 468\, 132 F.T.R. 281; Lemiecha (Litigation\nGuardian of) v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1994)\, 72\nF.T.R. 49\, 24 Imm. L.R. (2d) 95)\n \n[5]              \nThe\napplicant is claiming that\, in the case at bar\, the evidence thus adduced by\nthe respondent is not admissible and cannot be considered by the Court in this\njudicial review.\n \nIII.  Legal proceeding\n[6]              \nThis is an\napplication for judicial review of a decision dated April 10\, 2008\, by the\nImmigration Division (Record of Proceedings (decision part only) (RP) dated\nApril 10\, 2008: Applicant__s Record (AR) at pp. 6-11; Release Order dated April\n10\, 2008: AR at pp. 11A-11B).\n \n[7]              \nBy this\ndecision\, the Board ordered the release of the respondent subject to the\nconditions set out in its order\, including the condition of remaining at the Institut\nPhilippe-Pinel de Montr_al\, the condition of submitting his medical reports to\nthe applicant through his designated representative\, and the condition of\nnotifying the applicant\, through his designated representative\, of the end of\nhis treatment. It should be noted that the respondent is currently being\ntreated at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al for psychotic schizophrenia\nand is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality (Release Order dated\nApril 10\, 2008\, supra; RP dated April 10\, 2008\, supra).\n \n[8]              \nThe\nmandate of the representative designated by the Immigration Division under\nsubsection 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C.\n2001\, c. 27 (IRPA)\, ended with the proceedings for which he was designated.\n \n[9]              \nConsequently\,\nsince the designated representative no longer has a mandate under the IRPA\, he has\nno obligation to keep the applicant informed of the end of the respondent__s\ntreatment.\n \n[10]          \nFinally\,\nsince the defendant is not being __detained__ at the Institut Philippe-Pinel but\nrather is an __inpatient__\, the Immigration Division could not order him to\nremain there because only the Superior Court has the jurisdiction to order\nforced treatment\, and the Superior Court can vary its order at any time without\nnotifying the applicant.\n \n[11]          \nThe\nconditions imposed by the Immigration Division on April 10\, 2008\, are therefore\nnot valid and must be modified.\n \nIV.  Facts\n[12]          \nOn\nSeptember 2\, 2007\, the respondent\, Mr. Andral Loiseau\, was arrested for\ninvestigation because there were reasonable grounds to believe that he was a\npermanent resident inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for having\nbeen convicted of an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum\nterm of imprisonment of at least ten years (Notice of Arrest: Exhibit A of the\naffidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at p.15; RP dated September 4\, 2007: Exhibit B of\nthe affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp. 17-19).\n \n[13]          \nThe\ndescription of Mr. Loiseau__s criminal record in the Record of Proceedings (decision\npart only) dated September 4\, 2007\, which covers a period of five years (2002\nto 2007)\, reveals an escalation in offences and convictions (RP dated September\n4\, 2007\, supra; RP dated October 2\, 2007: Exhibit E of the affidavit of Francine\nLauz_: AR at pp. 32-34).\n \n[14]          \nAt the\ndetention reviews that followed Mr. Loiseau__s arrest\, the panel reviewing the\napplicant__s reasons for the detention continued the detention because Mr.\nLoiseau posed a flight risk and a danger to Canadian society if released (RP\ndated September 4\, 2007\, supra; RP dated September 11\, 2007; Exhibit C\nof the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp. 21-28; RP dated October 2\, 2007\, supra).\n \n[15]          \nAfter the\nhearing of September 11\, 2007\,\n a representative\nwas automatically designated under subsection 167(2) of the IRPA to represent\nMr. Loiseau (RP dated September 11\, 2007\, supra; RP dated October 2\,\n2007\, supra).\n \n[16]          \nOn October\n2\, 2007\, the Immigration Division issued a deportation order against Mr. Loiseau\n(deportation order; Exhibit D of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at p. 30).\n \n[17]          \nOn October\n16\, 2007\, the respondent filed with the Immigration Appeal Division a notice of\nappeal from the deportation order and\, on January 16\, 2008\, the Immigration\nAppeal Division prepared a notice ordering Mr. Loiseau to appear on April 11\,\n2008 (Notice of Appeal: Exhibit F of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp.\n36-37; Notice to Appear: Exhibit G of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at p.\n39).\n \n[18]          \nOn\nFebruary 1\, 2008\, Mr. Loiseau\, who was then being detained for immigration\npurposes at the Rivi_re-des-Prairies detention centre\, was admitted as a\npatient at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al further to the psychiatric\nassessments of Dr. Louis Morissette and Dr. Jacques Talbot (letter of Dr. Jacques\nTalbot dated March 12\, 2008: Exhibit J of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR\nat pp. 49-51).\n \n[19]          \nOn\nFebruary 12\, 2008\, the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al obtained from the\nSuperior Court of Quebec a judgment ordering \na.       that the respondent submit to\npsychiatric treatment;\nb.      that the treatment be\ninitially started on an inpatient basis at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al;\nc.       that the suggested treatment\nbe established in a generalized manner with regard to the entire hospital\nenvironment and any physician treating the respondent;\nd.      that eventually the treatments\ncontinue in any other health institution in the province of Quebec that accepts the respondent\nfor the entire duration of the order\, whether on an inpatient or outpatient\nbasis.\n(Superior Court judgment: Exhibit H of the affidavit of\nFrancine Lauz_: AR at pp. 41-43)\n \n[20]          \nAt the\ndetention review of February 13\, 2008\, the Immigration Division was informed of\nthe steps taken by the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al to obtain a judgment\nfrom the Superior Court of Quebec (RP dated February 13\, 2008: Exhibit I of the\naffidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp. 46-47).\n \n[21]          \nOn March\n13\, 2008\, the Immigration Division refused to review the detention on the\nground that it had lost jurisdiction further to the Superior Court order (RP\ndated March 13\, 2008: Exhibit K of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp.\n53-56).\n \n[22]          \nFurther to\nthe order dated April 1\, 2008\, of Mr. Justice Orville Frenette of the Federal\nCourt in docket IMM-1239-08 stating that the Immigration Division had not lost\njurisdiction and ordering it to review the detention of Mr. Loiseau on April\n10\, 2008\, the Division ordered Mr. Loiseau__s release on the following\nconditions:\na.       the respondent must remain at\nthe Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al for inpatient treatment;\nb.      the respondent must advise a\nCanada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer\, through his designated representative\,\nMr. Robert Naylor\, as soon as the attending physician decides to terminate his inpatient\ntreatment at the Institut Philippe-Pinel;\nc.       the respondent must submit to\na CBSA officer\, through his designated representative\, any written\nmedical report available on the treatments administered and the effects of the\nsaid treatment on Mr. Loiseau;\nd.      the respondent must comply\nwith the order of the Superior Court issued on February 12\, 2008\n(500-17-041014-088).\n(Release Order dated April 10\, 2008\, supra)\n \n[23]          \nOn April\n11\, 2008\, the appeal brought by Mr. Loiseau before the Immigration Appeal\nDivision was heard\, but no decision has yet been made (e-mail dated June 2\,\n2008: Exhibit L of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at p. 58).\n \n[24]          \nOn April\n17\, 2008\, Mr. Naylor\, designated representative of Mr. Loiseau\, sent to the\nImmigration Appeal Division a letter indicating what\, in his opinion\, was his\nmandate for a period of one year starting from April 11\, 2008 (letter dated\nApril 17\, 2008: Exhibit M of the affidavit of Francine Lauz_: AR at pp. 60-\n61).\n \n[25]          \nThe\napplicant claims that Robert Naylor\, who was designated as the respondent__s representative\nby the Immigration Division\, has no legal mandate to represent the respondent\nsince the proceedings before the Division are ended. Consequently\, the\nconditions imposed on April 10\, 2008\, by the order of the Immigration Division\nbecame null and void when the Immigration Division made its decision.\n \n[26]          \nIn\naddition\, the undertaking of the designated representative filed with the\nImmigration Appeal Division will also be null and void with respect to the\nImmigration Appeal Division when it disposes of the respondent__s appeal.\n \n[27]          \nThe\nImmigration Division does not have jurisdiction to order the respondent to\nremain at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al for inpatient treatment.\n \n[28]          \nFinally\,\nthe Immigration Division released the respondent\, erroneously believing that\nthe respondent was being detained at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al.\n \nV.  Analysis\n            A.  Relevant provisions\n[29]          \nUnder the\nIRPA\, the Immigration and Refugee Board has the discretion to automatically designate\na representative for a person who is unable to appreciate the nature of the\nproceedings before one of the Board__s divisions:\n\n\n\n\nPART 4\n \nIMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD\n \n \n__\n \nPROVISIONS THAT APPLY TO ALL DIVISIONS\n \n__\n \nRight to counsel\n \n167.

Application of the IRPA\n1.  Designated representative\n[30]          \nWhen at\nthe hearing of September 11\, 2007\, the Immigration Division noted that the Mr.\nLoiseau was unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings before the\nDivision\, primarily the detention review\, the Immigration\nDivision designated Mr. Naylor to represent Mr. Loiseau for the purposes of the\nproceedings.\n \n[31]          \nIt follows\nthat the only mandate that the Immigration Division could confer on Mr. Naylor\nis that of representing Mr. Loiseau during the proceedings before the\nImmigration Division.\n \n[32]          \nMr. Naylor\nis not a curator to a person of full age appointed under the Civil Code of Qu_bec\,\nS.Q. 1991\, c. 64.\n \n[33]          \nIn\naddition\, the undertakings set out in the letter sent by Mr. Naylor to the\nImmigration Appeal Division on April 17\, 2008\, cannot confer\, with respect to the\nImmigration Division\, a jurisdiction that is not provided for in the IRPA.\n \n[34]          \nAt most\,\nthis letter enables the Immigration Appeal Division to recognize Mr. Naylor as the\nrepresentative designated for the purposes of the proceedings pending before\nthe Immigration Appeal Division\, namely\, the appeal from the removal order\, and\nfor as long as the Immigration Appeal Division has not determined the appeal.\n \n[35]          \nConsequently\,\nthe Release Order does not provide any valid mechanism to ensure that the interested\nstakeholder is kept informed of the progress of Mr. Loiseau__s treatment\,\nincluding the possibility of his physicians deciding that his treatment could\nbe continued on an outpatient basis.\n \n2.  Jurisdiction of the\nImmigration Division\n[36]          \nThe\nImmigration Division has no jurisdiction to order Mr. Loiseau to remain at the Institut\nPhilippe-Pinel de Montr_al or to submit to any treatment.\n \n[37]          \nThis\njurisdiction lies exclusively with the Superior Court of Quebec under the Civil\nCode of Qu_bec.\n \n[38]          \nIn\naddition\, the decision to keep Mr. Loiseau in treatment at the Institut\nPhilippe-Pinel de Montr_al is the responsibility of his attending physicians\,\nthe institute and the Superior Court.\n \n[39]          \nNeither\nthe Superior Court nor his physicians are obliged to keep the applicant\ninformed in the event of a variation in the treatment order\, which the\nImmigration Division recognized when it found that it could not impose\nobligations on the attending physician.\n \n3.  Respondent is not being detained\nat the Institut Philippe-Pinel\n[40]          \nThe\nImmigration Division erred in believing that Mr. Loiseau is being detained at\nthe Institut Philippe-Pinel\, even if he is not free to come and go.\n \n[41]          \nThe\nSuperior Court judgment is not a confinement order within the meaning of articles\n26 and following of the Civil Code of Qu_bec or of\nthe Act respecting the protection of persons whose mental state presents a\ndanger to themselves or to others\, R.S.Q.\, c. P-38.001\, nor a detention of\nMr. Loiseau for immigration purposes.\n \n[42]          \nMoreover\,\nwhen Mr. Loiseau was admitted to the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr_al on\nFebruary 1\, 2008\, he was under a detention order for immigration purposes and\nwas being detained at the Rivi_re-des-Prairies detention centre. This order was\ncontinued on February 13\, 2008. This obviated the need to obtain a confinement order\nunder the Civil Code of Qu_bec or the Act respecting the protection\nof persons whose mental state presents a danger to themselves or to others.\n \n[43]          \nThis Court\nhas already determined that where the Immigration Division does not order continued\ndetention of a person because it erroneously believes that the person is\nalready detained\, the order must be quashed:\n[12]      In my view\, I need not deal\nwith the interpretation of section 128 of the CCRA.  It is clear that the\ntribunal member did not order continued detention because he was of the view\nthat the respondent would be detained in a federal penitentiary in any event. \nThat was not the case.  In arriving at his finding\, the tribunal member ignored\nthe initial approval of the respondent__s day parole.  He ignored the January\n25\, 2003 day parole eligibility document.  He chose to ignore the evidence as\nto the manner in which CSC approached the issue of day parole for those\nsentenced prior to June 28\, 2002.  He ignored the contents of the case\nmanagement bulletin that was before him.  He ignored the fact that\, despite his\nown views as to the interpretation of section 128 of the CCRA\, the respondent\nwould be day paroled on January 25th.  He erroneously concluded that the\nrespondent would be detained by CSC despite the overwhelming evidence to the\ncontrary that was before him.  \n \n[13]      Having\nreached this erroneous finding of fact\, the tribunal member then based his\ndecision upon it.  I conclude that the finding was patently unreasonable and\nwas made in a perverse or capricious manner.  The finding taints the decision. \nI therefore allowed the application for judicial review and remitted the matter\nback for redetermination before a different member of the Immigration Division\nof the Immigration and Refugee Board by order dated July 8\, 2003. \n \n(Ambrose\, supra\, by Layden-Stevenson J.)\n \nVI.  Conclusion\n[44]          \nFor all of\nthese reasons\, the application for judicial review is allowed. The decision\nmade by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board is set\naside and the matter is referred to a differently constituted panel.\n\n\n \nJUDGMENT\nTHE COURT ORDERS that the application for judicial\nreview is allowed and the matter is referred to a differently constituted panel\nfor redetermination.\n \n \n__Michel M.J.

Accordingly\, on April 11\, 1997\, I issued an order to that effect. These are the reasons which led me to make this order.\n      The Province seeks leave to intervene in these judicial review proceedings as if it were named as a party in the originating notice of motion.\n      The applicants in the main proceedings seek to set aside a decision or order\, or decisions or orders (the ""decision"")\, made by the Minister of Human Resources Development\, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\, or the Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency\, or any or all of them\, authorizing the provision of funds or financial assistance as described in section 5(1)(b) of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (the ""Act"") for the construction and operation of the Ptarmigan Trail in Nitassinan\, Labrador and purporting to determine or determining that the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects as defined in the Act.\n      On March 10\, 1997\, Teitelbaum J. stayed the impugned decision until March 12\, 1997\, at 10:00 a.m.. On March 11\, 1997\, Teitelbaum J. stayed the impugned decision for 9 days. On March 20\, 1997\, Rothstein J. continued paragraph 3 of the Order of Teitelbaum J. dated March 10\, 1997 and paragraphs 1\, 2 and 6 of the Order dated March 11\, 1997 until Friday\, April 11\, 1997.\n      The Province has advanced five grounds in support of its application to intervene as a party respondent. The five grounds are the following:\n\n \n          (a)      The Ptarmigan Trail constitutes a development of Crown land in Labrador and\, as such\, the Province will be the owner of the Trail and its associated infrastructure (warming huts\, etc.) once complete. The Applicants have made clear their intention to stop development of the Trail. The Province has a direct interest in the outcome of these proceedings as the owner of its natural resources\, and has exclusive constitutional jurisdiction to deal with these resources.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (b)      The Ptarmigan Trail project is regulated by the Province through the issuance of a development permit by the Provincial Department of Government Services and Lands. In addition\, the cutting of trees to make way for the Ptarmigan Trail is regulated through the issuance of a cutting permit by the Provincial Department of Forest Resources and Agrifoods. The Province""s exclusive constitutional jurisdiction to deal with its natural resources includes the right to issue permits and licenses. The efficacy of permits issued by the Province regulating development of the Ptarmigan Trail may be brought into question in the current proceeding.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (c)      The Province has a financial commitment to development of the Ptarmigan Trail through its funding of the Comprehensive Labrador Co-operation Agreement. The loss of funding from Human Resources Development Canada (""HRDC"") will represent a 50 percent reduction in funding for phase 1 of the Ptarmigan Trail development\, and possibly the loss of HRDC funding for the balance of the project. In all likelihood\, the loss of HRDC funding will be fatal to the future development of the Ptarmigan Trail\, resulting in a lost employment opportunities and provincial revenues from future use of the Trail. Further\, monies thus far invested by the Province in the planning and development of the Ptarmigan Trail\, through the Comprehensive Labrador Co-Operation Agreement\, will have been wasted. The Province therefore has a direct financial interest in preserving HRDC funding for this project.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (d)      In the Originating Notice of Motion the Applicants seek mandamus requiring the Responsible Authorities to\, as part of the environmental assessment\, consider the impact of the Ptarmigan Trail on the ""use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by aboriginal persons"". In the Notice of Motion for interim relief the Applicants asserts that the Ptarmigan Trail ""cuts across the traditional Aboriginal territory of the members of the Innu Nation\, who exercise Aboriginal harvesting rights in the affected area""\, and that the Applicants will suffer irreparable harm through an infringement on ""the exercise of their Aboriginal rights"" and increased access to an area in which the Applicants allege a ""constitutional priority right to harvest"". Further\, the material filed in support of the Motions characterizes\, without proof\, the Mealy Mountains as ""Innu land""\, and an area in which the Applicants have an ""aboriginal right to take food as that has been determined as a s. 35 constitutional right by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Sparrow and other cases"".\n                  \n\n \n\n \n              The relief sought by both in the Originating Notice and Interim Notice of Motion presupposes the existence of aboriginal rights held by the Applicants in the Mealy Mountains region of Labrador (the area of the Ptarmigan Trail) and is predicated on this assumption. The Court is being asked to accept as a fact that the Applicants have constitutionally protected rights in this region of Labrador\, and that the various federal and provincial environmental assessments are fatally deficit in failing to (in the mind of the Applicants) take these ""rights"" into account. The supposed triggering of the Federal Crown""s fiduciary obligation to consult with the Applicants is likewise predicated on the acceptance\, without question\, that they have aboriginal rights to the Mealy Mountains area.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n              There are no treaties covering the Innu in Labrador and whether or not the Innu can establish aboriginal rights in Labrador remains to be seen. (The Applicants have not sought to determine this issue in the current proceeding.) To the extent the issue of aboriginal rights has been raised in the Motions\, and the relief sought is predicated on the assumed existence of such rights\, the potential impact on property and civil rights within the Province and the Province""s ability to manage its natural resources (of which the Ptarmigan Trail is but one example) is obvious. It is essential that the Province have a full and complete opportunity to be heard on this issue as it may arise in the proceeding.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (e)      The Environmental Assessment Report prepared for HRDC by Dr. Stephen Barbour refers the reader to The Ptarmigan Trail: Environmental Preview Report\, prepared as part of the Province""s Environmental Assessment by Northland Associates Ltd. in 1994 (the ""EPR""). The Applicants made known their opposition to the Ptarmigan Trail in their submissions as part of the EPR. The Applicants assert that the EPR is flawed and to the extent the federal assessment relied on the EPR it must also be flawed. Issues raised on the Motion such as the alleged threat to the Mealy Mountains caribou herd go directly to the efficacy of the EPR. As such\, the Applicants challenge [sic ] of the federal assessment is in reality a challenge of the Province""s EPR through the back door. In order to respond to these allegations and defend the EPR it is essential that the Province be a Party to these proceedings.\n                  \n\n \n      In Re: Edmonton Friends of the North Environmental Society v. Canada (Minister of Western Economic Diversification) (1990)\, 73 D.L.R. (4th) 653\, the Federal Court of Appeal briefly discussed this Court""s jurisdiction to allow parties to intervene in proceedings where their rights will be directly affected by the outcome of the dispute. At pages 660 and 661\, Mr. Justice Stone stated:\n\n \n          The Courts have sometimes joined a party defendant even though no relief would be sought against him\, Gurtner v. Circuit\, [1968] 2 Q.B. 587 (C.A.)\, and have recognized also that the party joined would be enabled to resist the relief sought and be heard on the terms of any judgment: compare Amon v. Raphael Tuck  &  Sons Ltd.\, [1956] 1 Q.B. 357\, at p. 383. Much will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. This court has been willing to join a party in proceedings such as these simply because\, as that party""s rights will be directly affected by the outcome of the dispute\, he should be enabled to assert rights of appeal: Adidas (Canada) Ltd. v. Skoro Enterprises Ltd. (1971)\, 12 C.P.R. (2d) 67\, [1971] F.C. 382 (C.A.); Friends of Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport)\, [1990] 2 W.W.R. 150\, [1990] 2 F.C. 18\, 3 F.T.R. 108 (C.A.). The principle enunciated by this court in Adidas would appear to apply with even greater force where\, as here\, the s. 18 application is still pending in the Trial Division.\n                  \n\n \n      In stating his reasons\, Mr. Justice Stone referred to the English decision of Gurtner v. Circuit\, [1968] 2 Q.B. 587 where Lord Denning\, for the English Court of Appeal states at page 595:\n\n \n              The relevant rule is the new R.S.C.\, Ord. 15\, r. 6(2) (b)\, which says that the court may order any person to be added as a party\n                  \n\n \n\n \n              ""whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.""\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          That rule is in substantially the same terms as the old R.S.C.\, Ord. 16\, r. 11\, and nothing turns on the difference in wording. There were many cases decided on it. But I need not analyze them today. That was done by Devlin J. in Amon v. Raphael Tuck  &  Sons Ltd. He thought that the rule should be given a narrower construction\, and his views were followed by John Stephenson J. in Fire Auto and Marine Insurance Ltd. v. Greene. I am afraid that I do not agree with them. I prefer to give a wide interpretation to the rule\, as Lord Esher M.R. did in Byrne v. Brown. It seems to me that when two parties are in dispute in an action at law\, and the determination of that dispute will directly affect a third person in his legal rights or in his pocket\, in that he will be bound to foot the bill\, then the court in its discretion may allow him to be added as a party on such terms as it thinks fit. By so doing\, the court achieves the object of the rule. It enables all matters in dispute to ""be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon"" between all those directly concerned in the outcome. [footnotes omitted]\n                  \n\n \n      In Re: Starr and Township of Puslinch et al.(1976)\, 12 O.R. (2d) 40\, the Divisional Court of the Ontario High Court of Justice\, after reviewing both Canadian and English authorities on the right of a party to intervene in proceedings\, stated the applicable principle as follows at page 46:\n\n \n          I can only conclude from these cases that there is no absolute rule that for a party to be added he must have a direct interest in the very issue to be determined. It is\, I think\, sufficient in the words of Lord Denning\, supra\, that the ""determination of that dispute will directly affect a third person in his legal rights or in his pocket"". I also believe that it is clear from the cases that even when the applicant satisfies that condition it is entirely discretionary in the Court whether he will be allowed to intervene or not\, and the Court may always decline the application where it considers that the interest of the applicant is already adequately represented. [...]\n                  \n\n \n      With these principles in mind\, I am of the opinion that none of the grounds advanced by the Province\, save for the fourth one\, justify the granting of the Order sought by the Province.\n      In my view\, the Province did not demonstrate that the outcome of the dispute between the applicants and the respondents would directly affect its legal rights or its pocket. At paragraph 17 of their memorandum of argument on the Province""s motion to intervene\, the applicants state that:\n\n \n          It is submitted that the legal issue to be resolved in the context of this motion for intervention is not the correct test in law\, but rather its application to the instant facts. It is submitted that the Province is not directly affected in its legal rights or its pocket by the decisions or orders in issue\, nor would it be in the event these are overturned. Rather\, to the extent the Province is affected at all\, the effects are clearly indirect given that this is in essence a private project the Province has simply allowed to proceed\, and possibly indirectly through the terminated1 Comprehensive Labrador Co-operation Agreement to fund in part. All that the Province has done\, if it properly can be done\, can be done by the Province regardless of the grant or non-grant of federal funds.\n                  \n\n \n      I agree entirely with the submission made by counsel for the applicants. This disposes of grounds number 1\, 2\, 3 and 5 advanced by the Province. I now turn to the fourth ground advanced by the Province which concerns the question of aboriginal rights.\n       At the hearing\, counsel for the Innu Nation and the other applicants referred me to paragraph 12 of his memorandum of argument which reads as follows:\n\n \n          12. CEAA addresses explicitly the position of aboriginal peoples by it""s [sic ] inclusion\, in the definition of ""environmental effect"" ""any effect ... on health and socio-economic conditions on physical and cultural heritage\, on the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by aboriginal persons\, or ..."". With respect to the matter of Aboriginal rights\, the applicants have advised the respondents\, by way of clarification of their notice of motion for interim and interlocutory relief\, that:\n                  \n\n \n\n \n              [The applicants] do not rely on the existence of constitutionally protected Aboriginal rights\, except to the extent that such rights are recognized by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\, and except to the extent that as a matter of fact the respective land and jurisdictional rights of the Innu\, Canada and Newfoundland are now the subject to comprehensive ongoing negotiations.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          The applicants are prepared to place this letter in the record if so requested or required by the Court.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n               Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\, S.C. 1992\, c. 37\, s. 2\n                  \n\n \n\n \n              Letter of L. Hoffer to respondents"" counsels\, 3 April 1997\n                  \n\n \n      Counsel for the applicants then sought leave of the Court to file a letter dated April 3\, 1997\, sent by him to opposing counsel\, including counsel for the Province. As no one opposed the filing of this letter\, I allowed counsel to file it in the record. The letter reads as follows:\n\n \n          We have now reviewed the brief of Newfoundland in support of her motion to intervene in the above-noted matter. It appears to us that some clarification is in order with respect to the position of the Applicants concerning Aboriginal rights.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          Newfoundland""s brief correctly notes that we do not seek to determine the issue of Aboriginal rights in this proceeding.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          We write now specifically to clarify the grounds stated in the notice of motion for interim and interlocutory relief referred to in Newfoundland""s brief. We do not rely on the existence of constitutionally protected Aboriginal rights\, except to the extent that such rights are recognized by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act \, and except to the extent that as a matter of fact the respective land and jurisdictional rights of the Innu\, Canada and Newfoundland are now the subject of comprehensive ongoing negotiations.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          We hope that this clarification will be of assistance to you in considering your positions on the intervention motion.\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          We will be advising the Court with respect to the position set out in this letter and are prepared to file a copy of this letter should the Court request or require us to do so.\n                  \n\n \n      Counsel for the applicants submitted that his case had nothing to do with ""constitutional"" aboriginal rights and aboriginal territory except to the extent that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act recognized these rights. Section 2 of the Act defines ""environmental effect"" as follows:\n\n \n          ""environmental effect"" means\, in respect of a project\,\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (a) any change that the project may cause in the environment\, including any effect of any such change on health and socio-economic conditions\, on physical and cultural heritage\, on the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by aboriginal persons\, or on any structure\, site or thing that is of historical\, archaeological\, paleontological or architectural significance\, and\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (b) any change to the project that may be caused by the environment\,\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          whether any such change occurs within or outside Canada;\n                  \n\n \n      As I understand counsel for the applicants\, his clients"" challenge of the impugned decision is\, inter alia \, based on sections 1\, 4\, 5\, 11\, 12\, 14\, 15\, 16\, 18\, 20 and 55 of the Act. Section 20(1)(a) of the Act provides:\n\n \n          20. (1) The responsible authority shall take one of the following courses of action in respect of a project after taking into consideration the screening report and any comments filed pursuant to subsection 18(3):\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          (a) subject to subparagraph (c)(iii)\, where\, taking into account the implementation of any mitigation measures that the responsible authority considers appropriate\, the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects\, the responsible authority may exercise any power or perform any duty or function that would permit the project to be carried out and shall ensure that any mitigation measures that the responsible authority considers appropriate are implemented;\n          \n\n \n      In his letter dated April 3\, 1997\, counsel for the applicants further indicated that his clients were relying on the fact that their land and jurisdictional rights were now the subject of comprehensive ongoing negotiations with Canada and the Province.\n      At the hearing\, I indicated to counsel that I was of the view that if the applicants"" position was as stated in his letter of April 3\, 1997\, then the Province should not be allowed to intervene. The applicants will be relying on section 20(1)(a ) of the Act and hence on the definition of ""environmental effect"" in section 2 of the Act which refers to the ""current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by original persons\, ..."". The applicants are obviously entitled to rely on these provisions of the Act. To the extent that the applicants limit\, insofar as the issue of aboriginal rights is concerned\, their arguments and evidence to what the Act provides\, I do not see any reason to allow the Province to intervene.\n      Consequently\, any reference in the main pleadings and in the pleadings relating to the obtention of an injunction\, whether interim or interlocutory\, and in the affidavits filed in support thereof\, to the Innu Nation""s aboriginal rights and aboriginal territory\, outside the scope of sections 2 and 20 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act \, shall be struck from the aforesaid pleadings and affidavits. For clarity\, the applicants shall be entitled to refer to and invoke\, and thus lead evidence\, concerning the ""current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes by aboriginal persons"" but shall not be so entitled in regard to ""traditional aboriginal territory of the members of the Innu Nation who exercise aboriginal rights in the affected area"" and in regard to their ""constitutional priority rights to harvest"". Thus\, the debate between the applicants and the respondents shall be limited to those aboriginal rights\, if any\, which are referred to in the Act.\n      As I indicated earlier\, the applicants also wish to rely on the fact that there are presently ongoing negotiations with Canada and the Province concerning their land and jurisdictional rights. The applicants shall not be allowed to refer to nor lead evidence in regard to that issue. However\, the fact that such negotiations are taking place shall be deemed to have been proven. That shall be the extent of the applicants"" evidence on that issue.\n      I wish to make it clear that had it not been for the applicants"" revised position concerning their aboriginal rights\, I would have allowed the Province to intervene as if it had been named as a party in the originating notice of motion. By reason thereof\, the applicants shall\, as of this date and until the main application is disposed of by this Court at first instance\, serve copies of all pleadings\, affidavits and other material upon which they rely\, on the Department of Justice of Newfoundland to the attention of Mr. Don Burradge or to the attention of such person as Mr. Burradge may advise counsel for the applicants. Should the Province at any time prior to the hearing of the main proceedings be of the view that the pleadings\, affidavits\, and other material relied on by the applicants exceed the scope of my order\, the Province shall be entitled to reapply for leave to intervene in these proceedings.\n      For these reasons\, I dismissed the Province""s motion to intervene.\n      ""MARC NADON""\n      Judge\nOttawa\, Ontario\nApril 16\, 1997.\n __________________ 1 At the hearing\, counsel for the Province filed documents which showed that the comprehensive Labrador Co-operation agreement had been extended and was therefore ""not terminated"".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You are being directed to the most recent version of the statute which may not be the version considered at the time of the judgment.\n\n\nContinue \n\n\n\nDo not display this message anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",aboriginalFederal Court Decisions,Misquadis v.

HRDC implements its program through agreements (known as Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy Agreements (""AHRDSAs"")) with aboriginal organizations in Canada.\n[3]      The basis for the challenge by the applicants in this judicial review proceeding is section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the ""Charter""). The applicants claim that certain aboriginal communities\, both urban and rural\, have been excluded from participation in the AHRDSAs. The applicants claim this exclusion breaches the equal benefit without discrimination provision of section 15 of the Charter.\n[4]      This judicial review proceeding is being case managed and the parties have completed cross-examinations on various affidavits and supplementary affidavits filed in accordance with the Court's schedule.\nTHE MOTIONS\n[5]      The Attorney General for Canada made a two-pronged motion. The first prong is for leave to file a further supplementary affidavit of Robert Howsam pursuant to Rule 312 of the Federal Court Rules\, 1998 for the limited purpose of explaining HRDC's reaction to Kagita Mikam's refusal to fund a proposal request made to it by Ardoch Algonquin First Nation. The second prong of the Attorney General of Canada's motion seeks the exercise of this Court's discretion to compel the production of the Centre for Aboriginal Human Resources Development (""CAHRD"")\, the organization in Winnipeg\, Manitoba\, that won the request for proposal to deliver the urban/off-reserve component of programming to aboriginal peoples in that city.\n[6]      The applicants made a motion\, pursuant to Rule 316 of the Rules authorizing the applicants to call witnesses to testify at the hearing of the judicial review application on a factual issue relating to how urban aboriginal communities are structured in cities such as Winnipeg and Toronto\, how they function and organize themselves and how they address issues\, make decisions and are accountable.\nDISCUSSION\n\n \n      (a)      The Attorney General's motion \n\n \n[7]      The applicants did not substantively oppose the Attorney General's two-prong motion. They agreed that what the Attorney General for Canada sought was relevant and would be of assistance to the Court in the determination of this case. They said that what the Attorney General for Canada was seeking was intertwined with their own application before the Court to adduce oral evidence at the hearing on the structure of urban aboriginal communities.\n[8]      I am satisfied that the Attorney General's motion is proper in the circumstances and should be granted.\n\n \n      (b)      The applicant's motion for oral evidence\n\n \n[9]      As noted\, this is a judicial review application which normally proceeds on the basis of filed affidavits\, cross-examination and a certified tribunal record.\n[10]      Rule 316 provides that ""on motion\, the Court may\, in special circumstances\, authorize a witness to testify in Court in relation to an issue of fact raised in an application.\n[11]      The applicant urged two factors representing special circumstances. First\, the applicants argued oral testimony was required to sort out likely contradictions in the affidavits filed by the respective parties. Second\, counsel for the applicants said the nature of aboriginal communities are oral societies and that the history and politics of aboriginal communities is not found in books or in written materials but passed on through oral tradition.\n[12]      Counsel for the Attorney General vigorously opposed the applicants' request arguing that the applicants had not satisfied their burden to demonstrate special circumstances.\n[13]      Counsel for the Attorney General argued the existence of conflicting or potentially conflicting evidence is not sufficient reason and\, relying upon MacInnis v. Canada (Attorney General)\, [1994] 2 F.C. 464 (C.A.)\, urged upon me the applicants had failed to establish that affidavit evidence was inadequate\, not that viva voce evidence is preferable.\n[14]      I accept the submissions of the Attorney General for Canada. This Court in judicial review proceedings\, often sorts out conflicting evidence. This type of evidence in the record cannot be considered a special circumstance.\n[15]      Further\, I am not convinced by the applicants' argument of the necessity of calling four or five witnesses to explain how urban aboriginal communities are organized today and how they make decisions. It seems to me that providing such evidence in affidavit form is perfectly adequate.\n[16]      While I must refuse the applicants' request to adduce limited oral evidence on the structure of urban aboriginal communities identified in their application\, I am of the view that affidavit evidence on how these communities are constituted\, how they identify issues\, how they inter-relate and how they are represented is an important aspect of this case. I grant the applicants' leave to file limited evidence on how urban aboriginal communities function in Winnipeg\, Toronto and Niagara Falls which are the cities identified in the application.\n[17]      The order accompanying these reasons integrate the results of these motions into the schedule already established by the Court.\n      ""Fran_ois Lemieux""\n      \n      J U D G E\nOTTAWA\, ONTARIO\nSEPTEMBER 12\, 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You are being directed to the most recent version of the statute which may not be the version considered at the time of the judgment.\n\n\nContinue \n\n\n\nDo not display this message anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",aboriginalFederal Court Decisions,Bruno v.

However\, he was successful in his final internal Level II grievance application. The matter did not end there\, for Constable Bruno now says that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (""RCMP"") failed to apply the favourable final Level II adjudication. Thus the present application for\, among other things\, mandamus directing the RCMP to comply with the final Level II grievance adjudication of 8 July 2002.\n [3]                  In due course\, during the Rule 318 production of the tribunal's documents\, and here the tribunal includes the NCO I/C Staffing and Personnel NWR ""K"" Division\, the Crown refused to produce various documents on the grounds that production ""would be a violation of the privacy and integrity of Corporal Thorne\, Corporal Fraser and Corporal Ladoucer""\, who were the successful candidates\, and who had self-identified themselves as aboriginal.\n [4]                  Constable Bruno\, in his submissions to the Level II Adjudicator\, pointed out and here I will refer to the Adjudicator's decision\, that Corporal Thorne ""... does not look Aboriginal\, was not raised by an Aboriginal family; has never resided on a reserve or with any Aboriginal family members; knows nothing about values\, customs or traditions of First Nations people and does not speak any Aboriginal languages. It was not until three weeks prior to the promotion that Cpl. Thorne learned that he had a family member who was M_tis\, following which he obtained a M_tis card for $10 and identified himself as an Aboriginal ..."". Be this as it may\, the Adjudicator emphasized the job requirement that the successful candidate have an inherent knowledge of aboriginal lifestyle and culture\, concluding that :\n\n\n\n \n On behalf of the Grievor\, it is argued that he possess ""an intimate knowledge of First Nations' culture\, customs and values."" There is no evidence or claim to the contrary and I am prepared to accept that he has established a prima facie case that he possessed the job requirements set out in Staffing Action 99-05. Therefore\, if any or all of the three successful candidates do not possess the job requirement ""inherent knowledge of aboriginal lifestyle and culture""\, they should not have been promoted to the positions.\n \nI believe the Grievor was not given proper consideration for this position\, and he and the three successful candidates should be assessed as to whether they meet the criteria set out in the JOB of May 18\, 1999. If no evaluation mechanism to determine Aboriginal ancestry has been developed since May 18\, 1999\, and the date of my decision\, then Staffing should apply the criteria set out in Mr. Schachhuber's memo of October 18\, 1996. If it is found that the Grievor does posses this job requirement (""qualified promotable Aboriginal constables who have an inherent knowledge of Aboriginal lifestyle and culture"") and that any or all of the three successful candidates do not\, then the Grievor should be promoted retroactively to the date the first of the three successful candidates (not possessing this job requirement) was promoted.\n\n\n \n \nWhile key\, in the mind of the Adjudicator\, was the concept of an inherent knowledge of aboriginal lifestyle and culture\, also at issue is a failure to adhere to RCMP First Nations Policing Policy\, including an 18 October 1996 memorandum from the Official Languages and Diversity Management Branch dealing with identification of aboriginal applicants for involvement in the RCMP First Nations Policing Policy setting out three criteria\, that a recruit\, in the aboriginal applicant category\, look aboriginal\, proves himself or herself to be an aboriginal and have an aboriginal identity. This was expanded in a job opportunity bulletin of 18 May 1999\, dealing with the promotions now at issue\, which required that applicants be qualified\, promotable aboriginal constables with an inherent knowledge of aboriginal lifestyle and culture.\n\n\n [5]                  The Crown having\, as I say\, objected to production of a group of documents\, I directed\, pursuant to Rule 318(3) that the documents be produced to the Court\, in a sealed envelope\, that the documents be identified and described\, that the parties have the opportunity to make representations and that following an examination by the Court\, relevant and producible documents would be produced to the Applicant once the relevant appeal period or periods have run\, with documents determined not to be relevant to be returned in a sealed envelope to the Respondents.\n \nCONSIDERATION\n [6]                  Initially\, the Crown objected to a production of 13 documents. Documents which the Crown now objects to produce are five in number.\n\n\n [7]                  Considering the five documents\, which have now been produced to me\, with a brief reason why production is in each case denied\, I have kept in mind the basis of Constable Bruno's application and the general rules as to production of documents from a tribunal\, including relevance\, particularly in the senses of affecting the decision which the Court will make and in the light of the Applicant's material and supporting affidavit\, that filed 12 December 2002. I do not know\, directly from the Crown's representations\, which documents were in fact before the decision-maker\, that is before the NCO I/C Staffing and Personnel NWR ""K"" Division in considering the implementation of the decision of the Level II grievance adjudicator\, but believe that it is safe to assume all the material which the Crown objects to produce was before that individual as a tribunal when it considered the implementation of the Level II grievance award. I now turn to each of the five documents.\n \n(1)        ""Federal Court Review""\n [8]                  The first document\, which is undated\, is called 'Federal Court Review: Royal Canadian Mounted Police ""K"" Division Staffing and Personnel Response Prepared by S/Sgt. David N. Asp NCO I/C Staffing and Personnel for ""K"" Division'. The document is headed ""Solicitor-Client Privileged"". The document is not directed to anyone\, but rather appears to be a general memorandum or memoir. It is certainly a relevant document. The question is whether there is a privilege to exempt it from production.\n [9]                  The burden\, in the claim of privilege\, is on the party asserting the privilege. Here I have nothing more than the document itself and an assertion that ""when prepared it was noted to be 'Solicitor-Client Privileged' ....""\n [10]            In Jordan v. Towns Marine Electronics Ltd. (1996)\, 110 F.T.R. 22\, upheld by Mr Justice Noel\, as he then was\, (1996) 113 F.T.R. 226\, I set out the law as to privilege\, both generally and with respect to a report for which privilege is claimed. Mr Justice Noel also set out this passage\, to which I now turn:\n\n\n\n \n [19]       In considering whether a document is privileged\, this Court has adopted the dominant purpose rule described in Waugh v. British Railway Board\, [1980] A.C. 521. The House of Lords\, in that case\, adopted the view of Chief Justice Barwick\, who wrote the minority decision for the Australian Court of Appeal in Grant v. Downs (1976)\, 135 C.L.R. 674 at p. 677:\n \n       . . . a document which was produced or brought into existence either with the dominant purpose of its author\, or of the person or authority under whose direction\, whether particular or general\, it was produced or brought into existence\, of using it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation\, at the time of its production in reasonable prospect\, should be privileged and excluded from inspection.\n \n \n[20]       There must be a balancing of the discovery process\, on the one hand\, to allow a litigant claims of privilege where it is proper\, but on the other hand to recognize that it is in the interests of justice to make the fullest possible disclosure of relevant material capable of throwing light upon the issues in a case. For that reason a party claiming privilege must come clearly within the now well-established dominant purpose rule.\n \n[21]       The party claiming privilege has the onus of proving both that the report was prepared for the dominant purpose of being provided to counsel and for the purpose of using it in respect of existing litigation or litigation of which there was a reasonable prospect or was reasonably contemplated at the time of production of the document: see for example Marubeni Corporation v. Gearbulk Ltd. (1986)\, 4 F.T.R. 265; The ""Philippine Victory"" (1992)\, 49 F.T.R. 211; British Columbia v. Bagbusters Pest Management\, an unreported decision of Master Chamberlist\, March 24\, 1995\, Prince George Registry No. 27740; and Armeco Construction Ltd. v. Canada (1995)\, 83 F.T.R. 107 at 110.\n \n[22]       The question of privilege\, in connection with adjusting reports\, was considered at length by the B.C. Court of Appeal in Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club v. Uniguard Services Ltd. (1986)\, 1 B.C.L.R. (2d) 309. It is clear from that case that it is insufficient to show only that litigation was in reasonable prospect when the document was produced: the claimant for privilege must also establish that the dominant purpose for creating the document was to provide it to counsel either to obtain legal advice or to aid in the conduct of litigation.\n \n(Pages 28 and 29)\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn applying the dominant purpose principle\, in the present instance\, I have kept in mind that production of documents\, in the case of judicial review\, must not be equated with discovery of documents in an action. However\, there is nothing in the memorandum\, or in the submissions\, to indicate why this particular document was brought into existence\, or its dominant purpose\, either of the author or of whoever requested the material. There is nothing to indicate whether it was produced or brought into existence to obtain legal advice or to aid in the conduct of litigation which\, at the unknown time of its production\, was either in existence or a reasonable prospect.\n\n\n [11]            As I pointed out in Jordan\, the party claiming privileged document has the burden of proving both that the report was prepared for the dominant purpose of being provided to counsel and for the purpose of using it in respect of existing litigation or litigation of which there was a reasonable prospect\, or was reasonably contemplated at the time of production of the document. Here there was nothing to bring the memoir within the well-established law.\n [12]            There is nothing in the material to put the memoir into a time context. The Crown has not satisfied the burden of establishing facts to show that the memoir was produced with litigation in mind\, or was produced for the dominant purpose of contemplated litigation\, with the prospect of litigation being reasonable: see for example these criteria as set out in Commercial Union Assurance Co. PLC v. M.T. Fishing Co. (1999)\, 162 F.T.R. 74 at 75\, affirmed by the Court of Appeal (1999)\, 244 N.R. 397. This memoir must be produced.\n\n\n \n(2)        Memorandum from Cpl. D.R. Thorne\n [13]            This document is referred to as a memorandum from Corporal D.R. Thorne to the O i/c ""K"" Division Staffing and Personnel (1999-11-19).\n [14]            This document\, as described\, a memorandum in connection with the transfer of Corporal Thorne and his forgoing of his first choice of a posting given that another successful candidate was already in place there. The memorandum has no relevance whatsoever to the present judicial review and need not be produced.\n \n(3)        Memorandum from Cpl. S.C. Grier\n [15]            This document is a staff action memorandum from Corporal S.C. Grier to Constable D.R. Thorne\, dated 8 June 1999. It touches upon the cost of transferring two successful candidates between Detachments. It has no relevance to the present review and need not be produced.\n \n(4)        Memorandum from Cpl. S.C. Grier\n\n\n [16]            This document and memorandum from Corporal S.C. Grier to Inspector J.H. Hill\, dated 3 June 1999 sets out the identities of the three successful candidates and touches on redundancy of transferring two of the candidates between present postings. Again\, it has no relevance in the present judicial review proceeding and need not be produced.\n \n(5)        Ranking of Various Applicants\n [17]            This document\, setting out the ranking of the applicants for the promotion\, is undated. It sets out the location of each of the candidates and their preference as to posting should they be successful. It is only relevant\, in part\, in that it sets out Constable Bruno's ranking\, 9th out of 15. The positions of the unsuccessful candidates are irrelevant\, as are the rankings\, among themselves\, of the three successful candidates.\n [18]            I do not see that the document would in any way affect the outcome of this judicial review for it is unnecessary and extraneous to the relief which Constable Bruno seeks. The document need not be produced.\n \n \nCONCLUSION\n\n\n [19]            The only document that must be produced is the undated memoir\, 'Federal Court Review: Royal Canadian Mounted Police ""K"" Division Staffing and Personnel Response Prepared by S/Sgt. David N. Asp NCO I/C Staffing and Personnel for ""K"" Division'\, the heading of which ""Solicitor-Client Privileged"" is not borne out by any material. However\, for the present\, the documents will be re-placed and sealed in their original envelope\, pending the outcome of any appeals\, or the running of any appeal periods.\n(Sgd.) ""John A.

Arnovitch dated November 21\, 2000\, wherein she dismissed the respondent's motion to convert the applicants' judicial review application into an action pursuant to section 18.4 of the Federal Court Act. In the alternative\, the respondent challenges an irregularity in the judicial review application insofar as the grounds pleaded do not conform with Rule 301(e) of the Federal Court Rules.\n[2]      The applicants are members of four Indian bands which form part of the Sto:lo Aboriginal Nation and are representing aboriginal people living in or around Chilliwack\, British Columbia. In July of 2000 they commenced a judicial review application in this Court challenging the validity of Order-in-Council P.C.-2000-925 dated June 16\, 2000\, which authorizes the Minister of Defence to transfer title of approximately sixty-two hectares of land to the Canada Lands Company Limited pursuant to the Federal Real Property Act\, S.C. 1991\, c. 50.\n[3]      The respondent brought a motion to convert the judicial review application into an action on the basis that the application and supporting evidence raised the issue of proof of aboriginal rights and title to the lands in question. Prothonotary Aronovitch dismissed the Respondent's motion by decision dated November 21\, 2000\, stating her reasons\, in part\, as follows:\n\n \n      I accept that the matter for determination in this application is not as to the title or rights of the applicants in the land at issue. The applicants in this judicial review are seeking to establish the scope of the fiduciary duty and obligations of the Crown to them\, if any\, on the facts of this case namely\, in the circumstances where the Crown has knowledge of a claim as well as the basis of evidence supporting the claim.\n\n \n\n \n      It may well be\, that the application\, as the respondent suggests\, will be unsuccessful in establishing a duty or a breach thereof on the basis of asserted rather than proven rights. That\, however\, goes to the merits of the judicial review and that deficiency in grounds can\, and I am sure will\, be argued by Canada in defence.\n\n \n\n \n      As to the evidenciary matters\, I accept that the applicants' affidavit evidence\, including regarding the central and contested issue of the establishment of the Douglas reserve and ensuing reserve rights to the Sto:lo\, is proffered by the applicants as evidence of the basis or reasonableness of their claim as asserted and not\, as proof of entitlement or the existence of reserve rights as such.\n\n \n\n \n      Accordingly\, in my view\, neither the Court\, nor Canada will be prejudiced\, in one case by having to determine\, and in the other by having to disprove entitlement to such rights in the context of a summary proceeding\, on insufficient or untested evidence.\n\n \n\n \n      If and when rights and title have to be determined\, the matter can be set down for trial and will require full discoveries and cross-examination before the trier of fact.\n\n \n   [4]      The respondent now appeals from that decision on the grounds that the Prothonotary erred in law by finding that the applicants did not intend to prove aboriginal rights or title to the lands in question\, but instead had a reasonably founded assertion of such rights and that this ""assertion theory"" did not require determination by way of an action.\n[5]      I am allowing the appeal for the following reasons.\n[6]      The jurisprudence has clearly established that cases which require proof of aboriginal rights or title require determination by way of an action. In MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Mullin et al. (1985)\, 61 B.C.L.R. 145\, one of the first cases to reach the courts dealing with claims of this nature\, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected the assertion that aboriginal rights or title could be determined on the basis of affidavit evidence. The Court stated at p. 151:\n \n \n      I am firmly of the view that the claim to Indian title cannot be rejected at this stage of the litigation. The questions raised by the claim are not the type of questions that should be decided on an interlocutory application. A great amount of factual evidence will have to be heard and considered\, opinion evidence of those knowledgeable in these matters will have to be assembled and related to the factual evidence\, and there will have to be a meticulous study of the law. That must take place at a trial; it cannot be done on an interlocutory application.\n\n \n   [7]      This same reasoning has been applied in a number of subsequent cases including Barlow v. Canada\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 282 (T.D.); Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. Tulsequah Chief Mine Project (April 30\, 1999) Vancouver Registry No. A990300 (B.C.S.C.); Athabasca Tribal Council v. Alberta (Minister of Environmental Protection) (1985)\, 15 Admin. L.R. (3d) 110 (Alta. Q.B.); Calliou and Kelly Lake Cree Nation v. Canada (Ministry of Energy and Mines)\, (September 21\, 1998\, Vancouver Registry No. C984320 (B.C.S.C.); British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Westbank First Nation [2000] B.C.J. No. 1613 (B.C.S.C.).\n[8]      The most recent decision on this question is Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)\, [2000] B.C.J. No. 2427 (B.C.S.C.)\, a case which deals with issues which are very similar\, if not identical\, to those raised in the case at bar. The Haida Nation judgment concerns a legal challenge by the Haida to certain statutory decisions made by the British Columbia Minister of Forests relating to timber harvesting on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The grounds raised at the hearing and addressed by the Court were that the assertion of aboriginal title gives rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the Provincial Crown and triggers the protection of section 35 of the Constitution Act\, 1982.\n[9]      In dismissing the Haida's petition\, the British Columbia Supreme Court held that the assertion of aboriginal title cannot be determined without a trial. The Court stated at p. 8 as follows:\n\n \n      I see fundamental weaknesses in the petitioners' argument. First\, it purports to cast an onus on the Crown to disprove the asserted Aboriginal title of the Haida to all of the lands of Block 6. If the Crown has not done this\, so the argument goes\, the existence of Haida title to Block 6 must be presumed. But more than that\, the argument requires that Haida title be presumed to exist\, to the extent claimed by the Haida. Only if that presumption is made\, can the argument proceed to the next step\, namely\, the contention that Haida title must be given ""priority"". This would permit the petitioners to argue that the Crown had the duty to ""accommodate"" Haida title. But I have concluded that there is no such presumption\, in law.\n\n \n\n \n      The petitioners are saying\, in effect\, that the Crown has the burden of proving ""justification"" for infringing rights that have not yet been proved\, in kind or in extent. In my opinion\, the issue of whether there has been infringement of Aboriginal right cannot be decided until both the kind of right\, and its extent\, have been established. I think the fatal flaw is that the petitioners want results that could be achieved at a trial\, and only after the Haida proved their Aboriginal title\, and its infringement.\n\n \n\n \n      My opinion is that the scope of the Crown's fiduciary duty to the Haida cannot be determined without a trial. Whether the duty requires that priority be given to Aboriginal title\, and if so\, whether the measures taken by the Crown are consistent with the principle of priority\, are issues that depend on the nature and extent of the Aboriginal right or title at issue. In my view\, the judgement of Lamer\, C.J.C. in Delgamuukw at paragraphs 162 to 167 indicates that these questions are matters for trial.\n\n \n   [10]      That reasoning is equally applicable to the case now before me. The applicants' judicial review application as currently pleaded raises the issues of proof of aboriginal rights and title. These are questions which can only be determined by way of a trial and accordingly the applicants' judicial review application should be converted into an action.\n[11]      Finally\, the applicants submit that the fiduciary duty owed to them by the Crown and the accompanying fiduciary obligation to consult\, are enforceable prior to the proof of the existence of rights and title to the land in question. I have reviewed the cases on which the applicants rely in support of their argument and am satisfied that they are distinguishable insofar as they arose in the context of existing treaty negotiations or an obligation arising under the statutory framework of the Environmental Assessment Act. In this regard\, I agree with the British Columbia Supreme Court in British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Westbank First Nation\, [2000] B.C.J. No. 1613 that the cases cited by the applicant on this point do not stand for the proposition that a fiduciary obligation to consult arises merely in the face of asserted rights.\n[12]      For these reasons\, the appeal from the Prothonotary's decision is allowed. The applicants' judicial review application is hereby converted into an action pursuant to section 18.4 of the Federal Court Act. If the applicants choose to proceed\, this matter is to be managed as a specially managed proceeding.\n                                       JUDGE\nOTTAWA\, Ontario\nJanuary 29\, 2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You are being directed to the most recent version of the statute which may not be the version considered at the time of the judgment.\n\n\nContinue \n\n\n\nDo not display this message anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",aboriginalFederal Court Decisions,Native Council of Nova Scotia v.

The third ground listed in the Applicant's application is not\, for the purpose of this motion\, in contention any more since at the hearing counsel for the Applicant agreed to replace it with a more appropriate wording. We shall return to that point at paragraph 28\, infra.\n \n[2]                 The Respondent alleges in its motion that the second ground for review has no possibility of success\, that it is barred by issue estoppel and re-litigating it would amount to an abuse of process.\n \nFACTS\n[3]                 The relevant facts at the foundation of this motion are as follows.\n \n[4]                 The Applicant is a society registered pursuant to the Societies Act\, R.S.N.S. 1989\, c. 435. It represents M_tis and off-reserve/non-status Aboriginal people\, and seeks to enforce the Aboriginal and Treaty rights enjoyed by these individuals.\n \n[5]                 In 2001\, the Applicant\, together with several individual plaintiffs\, commenced an action against the Respondent\, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans\, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs\, and the Interlocutor for M_tis and Non-Status Indians (the 2001 Action). It was alleged that the Crown had failed to meet its duty of consultation with respect to aboriginal rights and fishing agreements.\n \n[6]                 The Applicant and individual plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants had breached their duty of consultation\, a declaration setting out the process to be followed in the future in order to comply with that duty\, and an injunction preventing the defendants from making decisions if they had not complied with the process. In addition\, the Applicant and individual plaintiffs sought certiorari to quash decisions made without consultation.\n \n[7]                 The Respondent brought a motion seeking an order striking the statement of claim or\, in the alternative\, that portions of the claim be struck and the Applicant removed as a party to the litigation. The decision on this motion was rendered on January 4\, 2002 at Native Council of Nova Scotiav. Canada (Attorney General)\, 2002 FCT 6 (hereinafter Native Council). There\, Blanchard\, J. declined to strike the claim in its entirety\, as it was not without the possibility of success. However\, the body of the statement of claim was struck as it was found to be deficient\, and the plaintiffs were given the opportunity to amend it. \n \n[8]                 In addition\, the Applicant was removed as a party to the litigation as it\, as a registered society\, did not have the same interest as the individual plaintiffs. It was not a necessary party to the action as the result would not be binding upon it and the issue could be resolved without its participation. This decision was not appealed.\n \n[9]                 On May 18\, 2005\, the Applicant filed the application that is the subject of this motion. It seeks judicial review of an April 22\, 2005 decision made by Fisheries and Oceans Canada to impose conditions on the Applicant's lobster fishery licence for food\, social and ceremonial purposes. It bases its application on three grounds: 1) the decision is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice and procedural fairness; 2) the decision is contrary to the duty to consult and accommodate Aboriginal people; and 3) the decision is contrary to the Applicant's right to hunt and fish for food\, social and ceremonial purposes (this latter wording has been replaced\, see paragraph 28\, infra).\n \n[10]             The Respondents filed the motion at bar on August 12\, 2005\, seeking that the second ground of the Applicant's application for judicial review be struck. It submitted that this ground had no possibility of success and was barred by issue estoppel\, as this issue had been litigated previously in Native Council. According to the Respondent\, the Applicant does not and cannot have aboriginal rights as it is a corporate body. Without these rights\, it is owed no duty of consultation.\n \n[11]             The Applicant submits that it should have standing and that the decision in Native Council does not govern the outcome of this litigation as Native Council dealt\, inter alia\, with the ability of a body such as the Applicant to bring a representative action. Therefore\, the issue estoppel does not apply.\n \n[12]             The Applicant also takes the position that the Supreme Court of Canada decisions in Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia\, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 550 and Haida Nation v. British Columbia\, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511 are more recent than the decision in Native Council\, and that these decisions could affect the law with respect to the duty to consult.\n \n[13]             The Applicant further submits that as individual Aboriginal people cannot easily in practice be consulted\, its members have chosen the society as the vehicle through which they will be consulted by the government. It says that it is a proper party by reason of necessity\, and that it has standing to insist that the Respondent fulfill its constitutional obligations to consult.\n \nANALYSIS\n \n[14]             For the reasons that follow\, I am of the view that the Respondent's motion regarding the second ground in the Applicant's application must fail.\n \n[15]             The legal test for striking out a pleading in an action is whether it is plain and obvious that the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action: Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and National Anti-Poverty Organization v. Canada(Attorney General)\, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735\, at 740.\n \n[16]             In a judicial review application\, as is this case here\, the test is as stringent and has been laid out in Bull (David) Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc. et al. (1994)\, 176 N.R. 48 at pages 53 to 55.\n \n[17]             There\, it was determined that a motion to strike out in a judicial review proceeding would only be allowed in exceptional cases:\n[T]he focus in judicial review is on moving the application along to the hearing stage as quickly as possible. This ensures that the objections to the originating notice can be dealt with promptly in the context of consideration of the merits of the case.\n \n. . .\n \nThis is not to say that there is no jurisdiction in this court either inherent or through Rule 5 [now Rule 4] by analogy to other rules\, to dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success. (See e.g. Cyanamid Agricultural de Puerto Rico\, Inc. v. Commissioner of Patents (1983)\, 74 C.P.R. (2d) 133 (F.C.T.D.); and the discussion in Vancouver Island Peace Society et al v. Canada(Minister of National Defence) et al\, [1994] 1 F.C. 102 (T.D.)\, at 120-121; 64 F.T.R. 127 (F.C.T.D.). Such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases such as the present where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion.\n \n[Underlining added.]\n \n[18]             The second ground of the Applicant's application concerns the ""duty to consult and accommodate Aboriginal people"" and the allegation that the impugned decision is contrary to this duty. I note that the Applicant is not arguing that the decision is contrary to the duty to consult with itself as a society. Rather\, it is asserting the right of consultation of its members.\n \n[19]             The Applicant takes the position that individuals would not be able to obtain consultation or challenge the impugned decision alone as they are not aware of the history of negotiations between the Applicant and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. This renders it necessary for the Applicant to act as their representative in this litigation.\n \n[20]             I agree with the Applicant's position that the decision of this Court in Native Council does not govern the outcome of this motion since that decision dealt with the ability of the Applicant to bring a representative action.\n \n[21]             There is case law which suggests that aboriginal rights cannot be separated from the duty to consult\, including First Nations of Saskatchewan v. Canada(Attorney General)\, 2002 FCT 1001\, to which the Respondent refers. However\, there is no case law which makes this point clearly\, possibly because the law with respect to the duty to consult remains in a state of development. As a result of the lack of certainty on this point\, it is not plain and obvious that the Respondent is correct.\n \n[22]             The duty to consult is still being defined and interpreted by various levels of court in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in Haida Nation discusses the need to consult ""Aboriginal peoples"" (see\, for example\, para. 45) and ""Aboriginal groups"" (para. 48). The representative party for the Haida First Nation was the Council of the Haida Nation; the Court did not comment on the appropriateness of this group as a representative party. The TakuRiver judgment discusses consulting and accommodating ""Aboriginal peoples"" (para. 21) and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation as a whole (see\, for example\, para. 46). Neither of these cases conclude that there is an obligation for the Crown to consult with individual members of aboriginal communities.\n \n[23]             The language used by the Supreme Court of Canada could be construed as expanding the duty to consult to aboriginal organizations. Under such a construction\, it may be possible to allow representative proceedings by aboriginal groups which do not attract substantive aboriginal rights themselves\, particularly in cases where their individual members would otherwise have difficulty obtaining consultation.\n \n[24]             Here\, it was brought to the attention of the Court that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans did consult the Applicant with respect to a previous licence\, although the Defendant sustained vigorously that said consultation addressed solely fisheries management issues and were not intended to recognize any aboriginal rights.\n \n[25]             Therefore\, the issue as to whether aboriginal procedural rights can exist independently from the aboriginal substantive rights remains open and\, from my point of view\, requires further argument and examination prior to determination.\n \n[26]             Recently\, the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the duty to consult in Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada(Minister of Canadian Heritage)\, 2005 SCC 69. This case dealt with the duty to consult treaty signatories if Crown development projects could affect treaty rights. The applicability of the duty to consult aboriginal organizations in such a fashion was not really addressed or clarified. It would appear therefore that this issue remains uncertain and open for debate.\n \n[27]             Therefore\, while it is possible that the second ground of the Applicant's application will be unsuccessful at the merits on judicial review\, it is not plain and obvious that it is devoid of merit. Thus\, the Applicant's second ground will not be struck from the pleadings.\n \n[28]             As for the third ground found in the Applicant's application\, as indicated earlier\, counsel for the Applicant has agreed to replace it with the following wording:\nFOC's decision violates the Aboriginal Fisheries Arrangement between DFO and NCNS dated the 26th day of January\, 2005.\n \n[29]             Counsel for the Respondent has agreed as to form to this wording. Of course\, the Respondent remains and intends to oppose said ground at the merits. Therefore\, said wording is deemed to replace the initial wording of the third ground in the Applicant's application without the necessity for the Applicant to serve and file an Amended Notice of Application.\n \n[30]             Consequently\, the Respondent's motion to strike is denied\, with costs in the cause.\n \n[31]             Pursuant to Rule 8 of the Federal Courts Rules\, the time for serving and filing the Respondent's affidavits is extended to January 27\, 2006.\n \n \n""Richard Morneau""\n\nPROTHONOTARY\n\n                                                                 FEDERAL COURT\n \n                                                        SOLICITORS OF RECORD\n \n\n  \n DOCKET:                                 T-872-05\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n   \n \nNATIVE COUNCIL OF NOVA SCOTIA\n                                                                           Applicant\n \nand\n \nATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA\n                                                                       Respondent\n\n  \n \n \n \nPLACE OF HEARING:                               Halifax\, Nova Scotia\n \nDATE OF HEARING:                                 December 8\, 2005\n \nREASONS FOR ORDER:                         Richard Morneau\, Esq.\, Prothonotary\n \nDATE OF REASONS FOR ORDER:       December 22\, 2005\n \n \nAPPEARANCES:\n \n\n  \n\n\n Mr. D.

The first half purports to situate the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples [hereinafter the ""RCAP Report""] ""in relation to the efforts to respect aboriginal and treaty rights in the Western or Eurocentric legal traditions."" To facilitate a ""contextual understanding"" of the RCAP Report\, the Henderson Report summarizes several legal reviews of the rights of Aboriginal peoples\, which occurred after European discovery of the American continent. The legal reports\, or commissions\, which are reviewed in the Henderson report are Franciscus de Vitoria's De Indus et de Iivre Belli Relectiones\, which stemmed from an analysis of aboriginal rights in the New World commissioned by the Spanish Regent Charles V in 1526 and published in 1532; the 1664 Royal Commission established by King Charles II in regard to the British colonies in North America; and finally\, the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Aborigines\, 1837.\n\n \n\n \n[4]      The second half of the Henderson Report provides a summary\, or overview\, of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples [hereinafter ""RCAP""]\, which was established by the federal government and issued a five volume report in November 1996. The Henderson Report details the RCAP's mandate\, and provides highlights of select findings\, and recommendations.\n\n \n\n \n[5]      The Crown opposes the admission into evidence of the Henderson Report on the basis that it is neither relevant nor necessary. In oral submissions\, the Crown indicated that the main thrust of its argument is with regard to the aspect of necessity.\n\n \n\n \n[6]      The Crown has articulated four general objections. First\, the Crown submits that the Henderson Report consists entirely of legal and political argument. Second\, the Crown contends that the Henderson Report's political arguments should be addressed in a political forum\, as opposed to this Court. Third\, the Crown contends that the report's legal arguments are unnecessary because they fall within the Court's expertise and usurp the function of the trial judge. Finally\, the Crown submits that there is nothing unique or conceptually difficult about the RCAP Report that requires expert explanation.\n\n \n\n \n[7]      Samson plaintiffs argue that the Henderson Report will assist the Court by providing historical background and context for the evolution of the treaty process in North America in general\, and Treaty 6 in particular\, as well as the context of the treaty\, aboriginal\, and inherent rights which are the basis of the claims and constitutional questions to be determined in this action.\n\n \n\n \n[8]      Samson plaintiffs contend that the first half of the Henderson Report is necessary as it provides the Court with the historical context of Royal Commissions and their role in the development of Aboriginal/Crown relations over the centuries. Samson plaintiffs contend that this type of evidence is necessary for the Court to fully understand the relevant constitutional facts in this case. The second half of Mr. Henderson's report\, which deals with the RCAP and its final Report\, assists the Court\, according to Samson plaintiffs\, by highlighting technical and complex statements and conclusions\, and by providing an analysis and synthesis of the RCAP Report and the research on which the RCAP relied.\n\n \n\n \nThe Sanders Report\n\n \n\n \n[9]      Professor Douglas Sanders received a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Alberta in 1961 and a Master of Laws from the University of California at Berkeley in 1963. He has been a law professor at the University of British Columbia since 1977. His report\, dated June 25\, 1997\, is titled ""Historical Thinking and Practice on the Relationship Between Indian Tribes and the Crown in Canada.""\n\n \n\n \n[10]      The Sanders Report is divided into ten numbered sections. The sections purport to outline the legal historical background of the relationship between the Crown and Indian tribes\, and then trace its evolution and development in terms of policy and practice.\n\n \n\n \n[11]      The Crown objects to the admissibility of Professor Sanders' report on the basis that it is neither relevant nor necessary. The Crown submits that a significant amount of the historical background material presented in the report is irrelevant; the Crown also submits that the historical background to Treaty 6 has already been addressed by historians Professor Arthur Ray and Bob Beal\, who appeared as expert witnesses for Samson plaintiffs. The Crown also takes issue with Professor Sanders' extensive use of case law\, legislation\, Parliamentary reports\, and academic articles on legal issues. The Crown contends that authorities of this nature are clearly within the knowledge and expertise of counsel and the Court\, and are the proper subject matter of legal argument.\n\n \n\n \n[12]      Samson plaintiffs submit that the Sanders Report deals with the themes of protection\, benevolence\, trusteeship\, and assistance; central control of Aboriginal affairs; and the place of the Indian Act in developing Aboriginal/Crown relations and Aboriginal/Crown treaties. Samson plaintiffs contend that the Sanders Report deals with the historical context and evolution of colonial and state policy\, as well as evolving Aboriginal/Crown relations\, and will assist the Court in understanding the relationship established between the parties through Treaty 6.      \n\n \n\n \nLegal Principles and Analysis\n\n \n\n \n[13]      In R. v. Mohan\, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 [hereinafter Mohan]\, the Supreme Court of Canada dealt with the issue of the admissibility of expert evidence. Mr. Justice Sopinka identified\, at page 20\, four criteria for the admission of expert evidence: relevance\, necessity in assisting the trier of fact\, absence of any exclusionary rule\, and a properly qualified expert.\n\n \n\n \n[14]      Although Mohan was rendered within the context of criminal proceedings\, its principles have been considered and applied by the Federal Court within the context of aboriginal litigation.\n\n \n\n \n[15]      In Fairford First Nation v. Canada (Attorney General) (1998)\, 145 F.T.R. 108 (F.C.T.D.)\, Mr. Justice Rothstein dismissed the plaintiff's application to have a witness qualified as an expert. The Court referred to the Mohan criteria and held that the proposed expert evidence was not necessary for the Court to appreciate the issues in the trial of that action. Rothstein J. commented that the evidence might have been of assistance in that it summarized and organized much of the factual testimony; however\, he went on to note that that was a function for counsel in argument.\n\n \n\n \n[16]      In Mathias et al. v. Canada (1998)\, 144 F.T.R. 106 (F.C.T.D.) [hereinafter Mathias]\, the defendant Crown brought a motion contesting the admissibility of two expert reports. Madame Justice Simpson\, in her decision upholding the Crown's objection\, referred to the Mohan criteria\, as well as the prohibition against presenting legal argument through an expert witness.\n\n \n\n \n[17]      In the instant application\, the Crown contests the admissibility of the Henderson Report and the Sanders Report primarily on the ground of necessity. The Crown does not contest the qualifications of either witness as experts in their respective fields\, although some reservations were expressed regarding the research abilities of Professor Sanders.\n\n \n\n \n[18]      With regard to relevance\, Justice Sopinka held\, at page 20 of the Mohan decision\,\n\n \n\n \nRelevance is a threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence as with all other evidence. Relevance is a matter to be decided by a judge as a question of law. Although prima facie admissible if so related to a fact in issue that it tends to establish it\, that does not end the inquiry. This merely demonstrates the logical relevance of the evidence. Other considerations enter into the decision as to admissibility. This further inquiry may be described as a cost benefit analysis\, that is ""whether its value is worth what it costs."" See McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984)\, at p. 544. Cost in this context is not used in its traditional economic sense but rather in terms of its impact on the trial process. Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded on this basis\, if its probative value is overborne by its prejudicial effect\, if it involves an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its value or if it is misleading in the sense that its effect on the trier of fact\, particularly a jury\, is out of proportion to its reliability. While frequently considered as an aspect of legal relevance\, the exclusion of logically relevant evidence on these grounds is more properly regarded as a general exclusionary rule (see Morris v. The Queen\, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190). Whether it is treated as an aspect of relevance or an exclusionary rule\, the effect is the same. The reliability versus effect factor has special significance in assessing the admissibility of expert evidence.\n\n \n \n \n[19]      At page 23 of the Mohan decision\, Sopinka J. made the following comments with regard to the criterion of necessity:\n\n \n\n \nIn R. v. Abbey\, [insert citation]\, Dickson J.\, as he then was\, stated at p. 42:\n\n \n\n \nWith respect to matters calling for special knowledge\, an expert in the field may draw inferences and state his opinion. An expert's function is precisely this: to provide the judge and jury with a ready-made inference which the judge and jury\, due to the technical nature of the facts\, are unable to formulate. ""An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the Court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. If on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help\, then the opinion of the expert is unnecessary"" (Turner (1974)\, 60 Crim. App. R. 80\, at p. 83\, per Lawton L.J.).\n\n \n\n \nThis pre-condition is often expressed in terms as to whether the evidence would be helpful to the trier of fact. The word ""helpful"" is not quite appropriate and sets too low a standard. However\, I would not judge necessity by too strict a standard. What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information ""which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury"": as quoted by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey\, supra. As stated by Dickson J.\, the evidence must be necessary to enable a trier of fact to appreciate the matters in issue due to their technical nature... .\n\n \n \n \n[20]      In Mathias\, Simpson J. elaborated on the criterion of necessity and referred to the following passage from R. v. B_land and Phillips\, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398; 79 N.R. 263; 9 Q.A.C. 293\, at 415 [S.C.R.]\, where McIntyre J.\, speaking for the Court\, held\,\n\n \n\n \nThe function of the expert witness is to provide for the jury or other trier of fact an expert's opinion as to the significance of\, or the inference which may be drawn from proved facts in a field in which the expert witness possesses special knowledge and experience going beyond that of the trier of fact. The expert witness is permitted to give such opinions for the assistance of the jury. Where the question is one which falls within the knowledge and experience of the triers of fact\, there is no need for expert evidence and an opinion will not be received.\n\n \n \n \n[21]      In upholding the Crown's objection\, Simpson J. relied\, in part\, on the legal prohibition against presenting argument through an expert witness\, and referred to Yewdale v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1995)\, 3 B.C.L.R. (3d) 240 (B.C.S.C.) and Surrey Credit Union v. Wilson (1990)\, 45 B.C.L.R. (2d) 310 (B.C.S.C.). In Surrey Credit Union v. Wilson\, McColl J. held\,\n\n \n\n \nExpert opinions will be rendered inadmissible when they are nothing more than the reworking of the argument of counsel participating in the case. Where an argument clothed in the guise of an expert's opinion is tendered it will be rejected for what it is.\n\n \n \n \n[22]      Upon close review of the Henderson Report\, I conclude that its contents are generally political in nature and better suited to a forum other than a court of law. Indeed\, that part of the Henderson Report which deals with the RCAP Report appears to be more along the lines of a summary\, rather than expert opinion. And while such an undertaking may be helpful\, as the RCAP Report consists of five volumes\, it is not necessary and is more properly a function of counsel in argument. Furthermore\, where it details the RCAP Report's findings on section 35(1) of the Constitution Act\, 1982 and the scope of the federal Crown's fiduciary duties and obligations\, the Henderson Report again veers into territory not appropriate for an expert report. Such arguments or recommendations should be left to be made by counsel in argument.\n\n \n\n \n[23]      During the course of argument\, counsel for Samson plaintiffs referred extensively to the RCAP Report and read selected excerpts. These excerpts\, however\, serve to underscore both the political and legal nature of the RCAP Report. For example\, reference was made to Volume 1 (""Looking Forward\, Looking Back"")\, Chapter 6 (""Displacement and Assimilation"")\, pp. 173-183. Topics dealt with in this chapter included the differing assumptions and understandings of Europeans and Aboriginals; non-fulfilment by the Crown of treaty rights and promises; restoring the spirit of the treaties; and historical measures of control and assimilation on the part of the Crown through federal legislation such as the Indian Act. The content of these pages\, while partly historical in nature\, is generally political argument. More political argument may also be found in Volume 2 of the RCAP Report (""Restructuring the Relationship"")\, chapters 1 (""Treaties"") and 2 (""Governance""). Examples of overt legal argument may be found in Volume 1\, chapter 9 (""The Indian Act""). It is difficult\, indeed nearly impossible\, to fathom how Samson plaintiffs' proposed expert\, Mr. Henderson\, could be cross-examined on the content of the RCAP Report as he is not one of its authors. These remarks should not be taken to mean that the RCAP Report has no place whatsoever in this litigation; its place\, however\, is with counsel in the course of argument.\n\n \n\n \n[24]      The Sanders Report\, however\, is of a different nature. Professor Sanders was tendered as a legal historian. His Report purports to be an historical overview of Crown/Aboriginal relations and policy and how they have evolved over time. In the course of his Report\, Professor Sanders refers to cases\, legislative instruments\, reports\, and academic sources; however\, the context in which such references are made is that of the legal history of practice and policy by the Crown in relation to Indians. Granted\, counsel for either party could marshal the cases and other materials referenced by Professor Sanders\, but could counsel present them in the context of a trained legal historian? If one answers in the affirmative\, then Canadian legal history could effectively be barred from ever being an acceptable subject matter of expert testimony.\n\n \n\n \n[25]      A key issue in this case is the nature of the relationship between the parties and the resulting obligations and duties; the historical background and evolution of this relationship is therefore important and\, in this respect\, Professor Sanders' Report may be of assistance to the Court.\n\n \n[26]      Samson plaintiffs also argued that the general rules of evidence must be read and applied in light of the special nature of aboriginal litigation and the Supreme Court of Canada's directions with regard to adapting the rules of evidence to accommodate aboriginal evidentiary issues. Samson plaintiffs contend that the Mohan criteria should therefore be applied in the spirit of the sui generis nature of aboriginal litigation.\n[27]      The Supreme Court of Canada's directions regarding the approach to the rules of evidence that trial courts must take in the context of aboriginal litigation is found in R. v. Van der Peet\, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507. In that decision\, Lamer C.J. stated\, at pages 558-559\,\n\n \nIn determining whether an aboriginal claimant has produced evidence sufficient to demonstrate that her activity is an aspect of a practice\, custom or tradition integral to a distinctive aboriginal culture\, a court should approach the rules of evidence\, and interpret the evidence that exists\, with a consciousness of the special nature of aboriginal claims\, and the evidentiary difficulties in proving a right which originates in times where there were no written records of the practices\, customs and traditions engaged in. The courts must not undervalue the evidence presented by aboriginal claimants simply because that evidence does not conform precisely with the evidentiary standards that would be applied in\, for example\, a private law torts case.\n\n \n [28]      Lamer C.J. revisited these comments the following year in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia\, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 at pages 1065-1066:\n\n \nThe justification for this special approach can be found in the nature of aboriginal rights themselves. I explained in Van der Peet that those rights are aimed at the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by distinctive aboriginal societies with the assertion of Crown sovereignty over Canadian territory. They attempt to achieve that reconciliation by ""their bridging of aboriginal and non-aboriginal cultures"" (at para. 42). Accordingly\, ""a court must take into account the perspective of the aboriginal people claiming the right... while at the same time taking into account the perspective of the common law"" such that ""[t]true reconciliation will\, equally\, place weight on each"" (at paras. 49 and 50).\n\n \n\n \nIn other words\, although the doctrine of aboriginal rights is a common law doctrine\, aboriginal rights are truly sui generis\, and demand a unique approach to the treatment of evidence which accords due weight to the perspective of aboriginal peoples. However\, that accommodation must be done in a manner which does not strain ""the Canadian legal and constitutional structure"" (at para. 49). Both the principles laid down in Van der Peet -- first\, that trial courts must approach the rules of evidence in light of the evidentiary difficulties inherent in adjudicating aboriginal claims\, and second\, that trial courts must interpret that evidence in the same spirit -- must be understood against this background.\n\n \n [29]      In both cases\, Van der Peet and Delgamuukw\, the Court's comments\, or directions\, were triggered by what it held to be a misapprehension of the evidentiary value of oral history evidence. The Court was concerned with how lower courts treated\, or failed to treat\, oral histories as independent proof of historical facts; the Court's direction is that such evidence be admitted on an equal footing with the more familiar types of historical evidence.\n[30]      In my opinion\, the Supreme Court's directions regarding adapting the rules of evidence do not apply to the question of admissibility of the expert reports which are the subject matter of this motion.\n[31]      Accordingly\, it is my opinion that the Henderson Report is inadmissible and the Sanders Report is admissible for the reasons given above.\n       ""Max M.

I reproduce below the twenty-five (25) declarations the plaintiffs\nare seeking:\n[translation]\n \n1.     \nA\ndeclaration that the plaintiffs have Aboriginal rights and treaty rights existing\neverywhere in Labrador. \n \n2.     \nA\ndeclaration that the plaintiffs__ aboriginal and treaty rights extend to natural\nresources and include the right to exercise their way of life\, their customs\,\ntheir traditions and their traditional practices\, which are an integral part of\nthe distinctive Innu culture\, everywhere in Labrador\, individually as members\nof the Innu families and as members of their Innu community.\n \n3.     \nA\ndeclaration that the plaintiffs__ Aboriginal rights and treaty rights include (a)\nthe right to hunt\, fish and trap (right to harvest) anywhere in Labrador and to\ncarry out activities incidental to that right; (b) the right to sufficient\nwildlife habitat to be able to enjoy the right to harvest; (c) the right to move\nfreely anywhere in Labrador in order to carry out traditional activities; and (d)\nthe right to access Labrador__s natural resources and to use them for\nsubsistence purposes.\n \n4.     \nA\ndeclaration that the plaintiffs__ Aboriginal rights are independent of the plaintiffs__\nAboriginal title in Labrador.\n \n5.     \nA\ndeclaration that in addition to the Aboriginal and treaty rights described\nabove\, the plaintiffs _douard Vollant\, Agn_s McKenzie\, Jean-Yves Pinette\,\nMichel Pinette\, Jacques McKenzie\, Alphonse Ambroise\, Jean-Guy Pinette and _ric\nRock and the members of their respective families whom they represent (__Innu\nfamilies__) have an Aboriginal title and specific Aboriginal and treaty rights\non all land of said Innu families (hereinafter __Innu family lands__)\, namely the\nland located in Labrador and elsewhere between approximately the 52nd and 56th\nparallels of north latitude and the 64th and 68th meridians of west longitude\,\nbeing the tracts described at paragraph 29 and commonly designated as tracts\n258\, 211\, 247\, 239\, 220\, 220A\, 221\, 235\, 238 and 271\, including\n13 178 square kilometres over which the plaintiffs have complete control\nand jurisdiction.\n \n6.     \nA\ndeclaration that the Aboriginal title related to the Innu family lands and the\ntreaty rights of these plaintiffs include the right to use the natural\nresources situated on and below the Innu family lands.\n \n7.     \nA\ndeclaration that the Aboriginal rights and treaty rights of all plaintiffs and\nthe Aboriginal title claimed by the plaintiffs named at paragraph 5 are\nprotected by the Canadian constitution.\n \n8.     \nA\nspecial declaration that the rights of the members of the Innu families take\nprecedence over any other right\, authority or jurisdiction relating to the Innu\nfamily lands. \n \n9.     \nA\ndeclaration that for the Innu family lands\, the plaintiffs__ existing Aboriginal\nand treaty rights\, and in particular the Aboriginal title\, include (a) the\nright to the exclusive use and occupation of the Innu family lands; (b) the\nright to hunt\, fish and trap and to carry out incidental activities (right to\nharvest) on these lands\, without interference; (c) the right to use and\nexclusively benefit from all the natural resources in\, on\, above and below the Innu\nfamily lands\, including water resources regardless of their natures; (d) the\nright to control\, manage and exploit these lands and their natural resources\naccording to Innu laws and customs; and (e) the right to build constructions of\nany kind on those lands.\n \n10. \nA\ndeclaration that the Innu family lands are subject to Innu laws\, customs and\ntraditions as practiced and respected by the Innu families. \n \n11. \nA\ndeclaration that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 applies to Labrador and\nensures that the Innu Nation should not be molested or disturbed in its\npossession of Labrador as its hunting grounds.\n \n12. \nA\ndeclaration that all of Labrador and\, more particularly\, the Innu family lands\nare lands reserved for the Indians within the meaning of subsection 91(24) of\nthe Constitution Act\, 1867\, and section 3 of the Terms of Union of\nNewfoundland with Canada\, confirmed by the Newfoundland Act\, and\,\nsubject to the plaintiffs__ constitutional rights\, are of federal jurisdiction.\n \n13. \nAlternatively\,\na declaration that if the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador has rights in\nrespect of lands\, mines\, minerals and royalties belonging to Labrador\, the plaintiffs__\nrights shall be subject to a trust and are an interest other than that of the\nProvince in these lands\, mines\, minerals and royalties within the meaning of\nsection 37 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada and the Newfoundland\nAct.\n \n14. \nA\ndeclaration that any legislation of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador\ndealing with the lands or natural resources within the Innu family lands is\nunlawful\, unconstitutional and of no force and effect with respect to the plaintiffs\nand the Innu family lands.\n\n \n15. \nA\ndeclaration that any development project\, including mining\, forestry\,\nhydroelectric\, railway\, tourism and outfitting projects\, and all related work\naffecting the Innu family lands are subject to the consent of the Innu families\nof these Innu family lands. \n \n16. \nA\ndeclaration that\, without that consent\, any development project affecting the Innu\nfamily lands is unconstitutional\, unlawful\, void and ultra vires and a\nbreach of the Aboriginal rights and treaty rights of the Innu families in these\nInnu family lands and exceeds the rights of the Crown and the authority of the\nParliament of Canada and the Legislature of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n \n17. \nA\ndeclaration that\, under the common law\, treaties between the French Crown and\nthe British Crown\, on the one hand\, and the Innu Nation\, on the other\, and various\nconstitutional instruments\, including the Royal Proclamation of 1763\,\nthe Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada and the Newfoundland\nAct\, the defendant\, Her Majesty\, has\, among Her constitutional and\nfiduciary obligations\, the duty to recognize\, protect\, respect\, preserve and\npromote the plaintiffs__ freedom and right to exercise without interference\ntheir Aboriginal and treaty rights in Labrador and\, particularly\, on the Innu\nfamily lands.\n \n18. \nA\ndeclaration that Her Majesty has violated the constitutional and fiduciary\nobligations described at paragraph 17.\n \n19. \nA\ndeclaration that Her Majesty has\, inter alia\, breached Her\nconstitutional and fiduciary obligations to protect the plaintiffs from\nbreaches of their rights and damage to the Innu family lands resulting from\ndevelopment projects in Labrador.\n \n20. \nA\ndeclaration that\, subject to the plaintiffs__ rights\, all development projects\nin Labrador and particularly those that affect the Innu family lands are under\nfederal jurisdiction.\n \n21. \nA\ndeclaration that moreover\, and in any event\, Her Majesty has breached Her constitutional\nand fiduciary obligations to consult the plaintiffs about development projects\nin Labrador\, particularly\nthose that have affected the Innu family lands.\n \n22. \nA\ndeclaration that Her Majesty has breached Her obligations to apply federal\nlegislation concerning the environment\, social impacts\, navigable waters and\nfisheries to development projects in the Innu family lands.\n \n23. \nA\ndeclaration that\, with regard to any development project on the Innu family\nlands\, the developers must obtain various permits\, licences and authorizations\nunder federal legislation\, including the Fisheries Act\, the Navigable\nWaters Protection Act\, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and\nthe Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.\n \n24. \nA\npermanent injunction against the defendant\, Her Majesty\, ordering the\ndefendant\, her officers\, directors\, servants\, employees and agents and those in\nactive concert and participation with Her to take the necessary measures to\nprevent or to stop all development projects on the Innu family lands\, unless\nthe Innu families concerned have consented to it; to respect\, protect and\npreserve the plaintiffs__ Aboriginal and treaty rights\, including their way of\nlife; and to fulfill Her Majesty__s constitutional and fiduciary obligations\nrelating to the plaintiffs in accordance with the Honour of the Crown and Her\nMajesty__s constitutional jurisdiction under subsection 91(24) of the Constitution\nAct\, 1982.\n \n25.    \nAn\norder against the defendant to pay damages or expenses in the total amount of\n$525 million for breaches of their Aboriginal and treaty rights and damage to\nthe Innu family lands and for Her Majesty__s breaches of Her constitutional and\nfiduciary obligations towards the plaintiffs. \n \n \n[3]              \nThe\nAttorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador (the Attorney General)\, who\nhas been impleaded in the proceeding\, has filed a motion to strike under\nrule 221(a) of the Federal Courts Rules. The\nAttorney General submits that the lands described in the statement of claim are\nlocated in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador\, that the notice of\nconstitutional questions challenges the validity of some twenty-seven (27)\nprovincial acts and regulations identified by name and any other Newfoundland\nlegislation concerning natural resources; that the said notice alleges that [translation] __all of Labrador and\, more particularly\, the Innu family\nlands are lands reserved for the Indians within the meaning of subsection\n91(24) of the Constitution Act\, 1867__ and that all Newfoundland\nlegislation and [translation] __any\ndevelopment project affecting the Innu family lands__ was void. In short\, the Attorney General pleads as follows: \n10. The Federal\nCourt has no jurisdiction to grant relief as claimed in the Amended Statement\nof Claim in particular in respect of the plaintiffs claimed aboriginal and\ntreaty rights in relation to lands and resources with the province and the\nvalidity of provincial legislation. \n \n11. The relief which is\nclaimed in the Amended Statement of Claim in substance constitutes relief\nagainst the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador and is not\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. The claim in its entirety should\nbe struck out.\n \n[4]              \nJustice\nHugessen allowed the motion and struck out the amended statement of claim in\nits entirety without leave to amend (T-568-07). \n \n[5]              \nThe\nFederal Court has jurisdiction\, of course\, to hear statements of claims for\ndeclarations made against the federal Crown. The Court has no jurisdiction__this\ntoo is clear__to make declarations against a provincial Crown\, meaning that a provincial\nCrown cannot be summoned as a defendant in the Federal Court. \n \n[6]              \nIt\nis clear in this case\, as Justice Hugessen said\, that the province of Newfoundland\nand Labrador is an essential\nparty to the dispute.\nIf one excludes the declarations sought that focus on\nor concern the province of Newfoundland and Labrador\, virtually\nnothing remains to justify the continuation of a proceeding in the Federal Court.\nThis is why\, I believe\, the judge struck out the entire statement of claim\nwithout leave to amend.\nCounsel for the appellants have made no effort\, in\ntheir memorandum or at the hearing\, to convince us that they would be able\,\nwithout amending the cause of action\, to file a new amended statement of claim\nin which the province of Newfoundland and Labrador would\, for all intents and\npurposes\, no longer be an essential party. \n \n[7]              \nThe\nstriking out of an entire statement of claim is nonetheless an extreme remedy\nin a case in which the Court__s concurrent jurisdiction over some aspects of the\ndispute has been established.\nIn the case at bar\, the appropriate remedy would be\nthat contemplated by this Court in F_d_ration Franco-t_noise v. Canada\n(C.A.)\, 2001 FCA 220\, namely to stay the proceedings and to allow the dispute\nto be pleaded before the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. The following remarks\, at paragraphs 81 and 82 of that\ndecision\, apply to this case\, mutatis mutandis:\n[81]      It\nis clear\, from a reading of paragraphs 50(1)(a) and 50(1)(b) [of the Federal\nCourts Act]\, taken together\, that the Court may order the stay of a proceeding\neven though no other proceeding is pending before another court. As we know\, in\nthe case at bar no action has so far been brought in the Supreme Court of the\nTerritories.\n \n[82]      I\nwould have no hesitation in ordering the stay of the action if I had to\ndetermine the question. There is in the Territories a superior court that would\nhave jurisdiction in relation to all of the defendants and in relation to all\nof the remedies that are sought. No problem of jurisdiction\, standing\,\nprocedural vehicle or choice of remedy would be posed in the Supreme Court of\nthe Territories. The action could be carried to completion without the\ninterlocutory proceedings that have already delayed the progress of the\nproceedings in the Federal Court and that apparently are still not exhausted.\n \n \n[8]              \nI\nwould therefore allow the appeal\, set aside the judgment by the Federal Court\,\nand\, rendering the judgment which ought to have been rendered\, dismiss the\nmotion to strike and order a stay of proceedings in docket T-568-07. I\nwould grant costs to the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador before\nthe Federal Court.\nI would not award any costs on appeal.\n \n \n__Robert\nD_cary\n\nJ.A.\n\n \n__I\nagree.\n    \nMarc No_l J.A.__\n \n__I\nagree.\n    \nPierre Blais J.A.__\n \n \nCertified\ntrue translation\nJohanna\nKratz\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL\n \nNAMES OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\n \n \n \nDOCKET:                                                                              A-365-08\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                                                              Edouard\nVollant et al \n                                                                                                v.

The review sought involves a failure on the part of the Crown to invite the Applicants to be a part of the Founding Board of Directors on the establishment of the Aboriginal Health Institute. The decision referred to in the Notice of Application is not identified by any date or otherwise\, but is said to be that of the Minister of National Health. While the affidavit material is massive\, it seems to overlook both the decision and the founding of the Institute. I am aware from other sources that the Institute came into being in about 1998.\n \n[2]                   The Applicants are concerned that production of Rule 317 documents has not taken the usual Rule 318 course\, with directions as to submissions\, often with the Court examining documents which the tribunal does not wish to produce. The present situation did not lend itself to Rule 318 procedure because the general thrust of the Applicants' request for documents was akin to broad and unspecific discovery\, with many elements of a fishing expedition. Thus the Applicants were forced to bring the present motion.\n \n[3]                   The Applicants in their motion seek the production of four classes of documents:\n(i)                    any and all policy documents leading to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute;\n(ii)                  any and all cabinet documents discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute;\n\n  \n(iii)               any and all Treasury Board's submissions discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute; and\n(iv)               any and all reports\, letters\, papers\, submissions and written documents discussing consultation of national aboriginal representative organizations leading to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute.\nThese requested items are said to relate to the decision of the Minister of Health and Welfare ""... to exclude and not include Pauktuutit\, Inuit Women's Association from the Founding Board of Directors of the federally created Aboriginal Health Institute"" (Notice of Application). I will now turn to some relevant law.\n \nSOME RELEVANT LAW\n \n[4]                   The material which a tribunal must produce\, upon request\, pursuant to Rule 317\, is limited to ""... material relevant to an application that is in the possession of the tribunal whose order is a subject of the application ..."" and not in the possession of the party making the request. To elaborate on Rule 317\, it provides access to documents which an applicant does not have and which are in the possession of the tribunal\, but it does not provide for access to documents held by another entity.\n \n[5]                   Relevant material\, in the context of Rule 317\, must be considered in the light of the purpose of judicial review:\n\n  \n\n \n  \nIn essence\, judicial review is just that\, a review of a tribunal's decision which is based on the evidence which the tribunal had before it: to allow in additional material would not only be irrelevant\, but also would transform a judicial review process into an appeal process.  (Toft v. Attorney General of Canada\, an unreported 18 July 2001 decision in file T-264-01\, 2001 FCT 808)\n\n\n \n \nIn making this observation in Toft\, I relied upon a passage in a brief unreported 18 May 1994 decision with Mr Justice Nadon\, as he then was\, in Asafov v. Canada (MEI)\, IMM-7425-93\, [1994] F.C.J. No. 713.  This concept\, of a review of the decision itself\, is important in the present instance because the scope of the documents sought goes well beyond the review sought in the Notice of Application and\, one would expect\, well beyond the amount of material which the decision-maker in this instance could ever consider and absorb.\n \n[6]                   All of this is consistent with the current state of the law\, as set out by Mr Justice Pelletier in Hiebert v. Price (2000)\, 182 F.T.R. 18\, there referring to a position taken by Mr Justice Nadon in 1185740 Ontario Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue) (1998)\, 150 F.T.R. 60\, as approved by the Court of Appeal (1999)\, 247 N.R. 287 at page 289:\n\n \n  \n[5]     In. Pathak v. Canada (Humans Right Commission) et al.\, [1995] 2 F.C. 455 (F. C.A.)\, 180 N.R. 152 (F.C.A.)\, this Court held that only documents which were actually before the Human Rights Commission in making its decision had to be produced. Other documents relied upon by the investigator did not have to be produced in the absence of evidence that the investigator had inaccurately summarized them. To much the same effect is the decision of this court in Terminaux Portuaires du Qu_bec Inc. v. Conseil Canadien des relations du travail  (1993)\, 164 N.R. 60; 17 Admin. L.R. (2d) 16 (F.C.A.). I accept and follow these decisions.\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n[7]                   Rule 317 and the case law which has developed require production of only relevant documents which were before a tribunal. Here I would make two observations. First\, many documents may be in the possession of a tribunal\, in one way or another\, but not before the tribunal and to the extent that the Applicants rely upon Friends of the West Country Assn. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans) (1997)\, 130 F.T.R. 206\, that case is confined to its facts\, the legislation underlying it providing no distinct investigation and decision-making stages. As I say\, only documents which were before the tribunal which must be produced and then\, only if relevant. Documents are relevant\, in judicial review\, if they may affect the decision and come within the grounds of review set forth in the originating notice of motion and the affidavit: see Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Pathak\, [1995] 2 F.C. 455 at 460 (F.C.A.)\, leave to appeal refused (1995)\, 198 N.R. 237. However\, such documents must be identified\, not merely required en masse as if the process was discovery of documents.\n \n\n  \n[8]                   All of this may be summed up to reflect the summary nature of a judicial review application.    In judicial review production of documents differs from discovery of documents in that the former is narrower and more concise.  It is therefore up to an applicant to know his or her case on its commencement. It is improper to seek production of every imaginable document\, to fish for documents and to argue that nonspecific unidentified documents ought to exist and that if they exist\, they will found the Applicants' case. To take such an approach\, that of planning to build a judicial review application on unknown material which may not even exist\, material not even specifically pointed to let alone clearly identified in affidavits in support of an application\, would be an abuse. For that reason Rules 317 and 318\, which deal with production of documents by a decision-maker\, the tribunal\, must be reasonably construed so that the decision-maker\, particularly a decision-maker whose decision is not clearly identified\, is not put in the impossible position of producing reams of materials which may or may not have relevance. I will consider further the requirement that a request for production of documents from a tribunal must be specific.\n \n[9]                   In considering production of documents under Rule 317 one must keep in mind the summary nature of judicial review proceedings. Rule 317 may not be used for conducting broad-reaching discovery\, which may only be had by initiating an action: see Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Information Commissioner)(1997)\, 135 F.T.R 254 at 266 and Unger v. Telus Enterprise Solutions Inc.\, an unreported 16 July 2001 decision in file T-483-01\, 2001 FCT 803 at paragraphs 3 and 4.\n \n[10]             In Canadian Arctic Resources Committee Inc. v. Diavik Diamond Mines (2000)\, 183 F.T.R. 267 I referred at page 276 to an observation made by Mr Justice MacKay in Beno v. L_tourneau (1997)\, 130 F.T.R. 183 at 190 that a request for documents\, under the predecessor rule to Rule 317 must be specific:\n\n \n  \nMr. Justice MacKay went on to note\, at page 190\, that a Rule 1612 request for documents must be a specific request\, not merely a general description without knowledge of whether such documents exist. This corresponds with the present Rule 317 request for documents made by the Applicant and which\, if given effect to\, would result in complete discovery of documents.\n(p. 276 of Diavik)\n\n\n \n \n[11]             Beno v. L_tourneau (supra) is also instructive for the concept that the predecessor rule to Rule 317 could not be used to support a fishing expedition:\n\n \n  \n[23]       It is long settled that judicial review proceedings are summary in nature\, with no discovery or written pleadings\, and the rules relating to those proceedings\, including Rules 1612 and 1613\, are not intended to prolong summary proceedings or to permit a ""fishing expedition"" for information. (See: Trans Quebec  &   Maritimes Pipeline Inc. v. National Energy Board\, [1984] 2 F.C. 432; Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada - Krever Commission)\, supra). ...\n(p. 190)\n\n\n \n \nMoreover\, a request for documents from a tribunal must be specific in the sense of identifying the material requested. The request must go beyond a general description. The request may not be a fishing expedition for documents when a party does not know whether such documents exist\, even though they make a bald statement in argument that it is reasonable to expect that there are such documents:\n\n \n  \n[24]       Rule 1612(4) provides that a request (for documents) shall specify the particular material in the possession of the federal board\, commission or other tribunal. Here there is no request that qualifies within that rule for the applicants simply set out a general description for all documents of a described sort. They do not know whether any such documents exist though it is urged it is reasonable to expect that there are some such documents. It is my opinion that in each case the requests for documents are requests in the nature of discovery. If this were an action the respondent Commissioners would have the obligation to produce a list of all relevant documents and to indicate which among those\, if any\, are claimed as privileged.  But this is not an action\, and the applicants are not entitled to discovery. The requests in connection with these applications for judicial review\, in my opinion\, are a ""fishing expedition"" to find whether there are any documents which might assist in support of the applicants' case for judicial review\, about which documents they have no knowledge at this stage.\n \n(Beno v. L_tourneau at pp. 190 - 191)\n\n\n \n \n\n  \nWhile Beno v. L_tourneau was decided under the pre-1998 Rules\, the present Rules are parallel and similar in that they contain much of the same wording. Thus the principles set out in Beno v. L_tourneau apply in the case of Rule 317(1) which requires ""... a written request\, identifying the material requested."".\n \nCONSIDERATION\n \n[12]             During submissions the Applicants acknowledged that the initial request for documents\, which I would again set out\, was too broad:\n(i)                    any and all policy documents leading to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute;\n(ii)                  any and all cabinet documents discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute;\n(iii)               any and all Treasury Board's submissions discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute; and\n(iv)               any and all reports\, letters\, papers\, submissions and written documents discussing consultation of national aboriginal representative organizations leading to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute.\n\n  \nCounsel acknowledged that the Applicants were prepared to drop items (i) and (iv)\, requiring only production of Cabinet documents discussing the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute and Treasury Board's submissions discussing the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute.\n \n[13]             Both requests\, for Cabinet documents leading to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute and for Treasury Board submissions discussing the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute are still far too broad. This is particularly so considering that the Notice of Application deals with the narrow point of an unidentified decision said to be that ""... of the Minister of National Health and Welfare ... to exclude and not include Pauktuutit Inuit Women's Association from the Founding Board of Directors of the federally created Aboriginal Health Institute."". The lengthy affidavit material of Ms Dewar\, in support of this application\, refers to much discrimination but neither adds anything to nor illuminates the particulars of the decision.\n \n\n  \n[14]             Unfortunately the Applicants' voluminous affidavit material does not bear on or identify what documents might be available. Written submissions\, on behalf of Pauktuutit\, insist that various classified and unaccessible Cabinet documents exist and that ""if the documents requested exist"" they must relate to the Court proceedings. The submissions also go on to state that ""if the documents exist"" they must be ""related to or connected to those used by decision makers to discriminate against Inuit women based on sex and/or race."". This use of a conditional uncertainty results in much supposition and conjecture. The request for documents which\, if they exist\, must have been used by someone to exclude the Applicants and to discriminate against Inuit women\, is a pure fishing expedition.\n \n[15]              Leaving aside the absence of any real identification of the decision\, in the present instance the Applicants have not clearly identified what they wish to be produced\, so as to bring themselves within Rule 317. Rather the request is for ""any and all Cabinet documents discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute"" and for ""any and all Treasury Board's submissions discussing formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute"". Not only is this not within what is sought by way of judicial review\, a review of the decision to exclude Pauktuutit from the initial Aboriginal Health Institute organizing process\, but also it is an attempt\, by way of a fishing expedition\, to build a case upon documents the existence of which the Applicants are unsure.\n \n\n  \n[16]             The present request is also such that it is incapable of invoking a focused response from the Respondent. The Applicants should have made a more specific request for documents and indeed\, among the many affidavits of Ms Dewar\, is one sworn on 6 November 2001. That affidavit does seem to refer to a collection of documents held by the Applicants related to the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute\, but again the documents are not identified. To make an unbounded request for documents\, without an analysis to see what might or should exist to fill gaps in the material already held by the Applicants\, is improper for several reasons. First\, Rule 317(1) only requires production of documents which the Applicants do not already have: the materials of present Applicants give one no idea as to what the Applicants already possess and thus no idea as to place or time which the Respondent ought to search. Such information would be helpful in defining\, for the benefit of the Respondent\, the additional material which\, if in existence\, is that which the Applicants seek. Second\, to make it broad discovery-like request for documents\, without declaring what the Applicants already have\, smacks of a fishing expedition on which to build a case.  Finally\, to require the Respondent to sort through all Cabinet documents discussing the formation of the Aboriginal Health Institute and all Treasury Board's submissions discussing the formation of the Founding Board of Directors of the Aboriginal Health Institute\, and the failure to invite Pauktuutit to participate and then to have to decide on relevance and whether the documents were before whoever made the decision\, is a task out of all proportion to what is envisioned by Rule 317.\n \n[17]             The motion is dismissed\, with costs to the Respondent.\n \n(Sgd.)

By Interim\n      Order of Associate Chief Judge Bowman (as he then was) dated May\n      12\, 2003\, the appeals were set down for hearing on the quantum\n      issue only. Thus the only issue before the Court at this time is\n      whether or not the quantum of assessments dated October 1\, 1999\,\n      January 17\, 2000 and January 20\, 2000 issued to the Appellant for\n      amounts that it withheld\, but did not remit\, is correct.\n \n2.           To be\n      clear\, the Respondent maintains its position with regard to all\n      other issues as pleaded in the Replies to Notices of Appeal.\n \n3.           To expedite\n      the resolution of the quantum issue\, the Respondent prepared\n      schedules setting out the amounts withheld\, but not remitted\,\n      based on documents provided by the Appellant. The accuracy of the\n      schedules is admitted by the Appellant.\n \nPART I\n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n \n4.           In 1999\,\n      the Appellant was in the business of providing fire fighting\n      services in the summer and bush clearing operations in the\n      winter.\n \n5.           The\n      Appellant employed certain people to carry on its operations and\n      withheld amounts for EI\, CPP and income tax from the salary paid\n      to those people.\n \n6.           The\n      Appellant remitted the amounts that it withheld for the months of\n      January\, 1999 to June 1999\, but failed to remit the amounts that\n      it withheld for the months of July\, 1999 to December\, 1999.\n \n7.           The\n      assessment dated October 1\, 1999 assessed amounts withheld\, but\n      not remitted\, for the months of July and August\, 1999.\n \n8.           The\n      assessment dated January 17\, 2000 assessed amounts withheld\, but\n      not remitted\, for the month of September\, 1999.\n \n9.           The\n      assessment dated January 20\, 2000 assessed amounts withheld\, but\n      not remitted\, for the months of October\, November and December\,\n      1999.\n \n10.         Tbe total amount\n      withheld\, but not remitted\, for the period July\, 1999 to\n      December\, 1999 was $44\,567.18. The three assessments in issue\n      assess the amount of $44\,566.50 (68 cents less than the amount\n      actually withheld).\n \n11.         The Appellant has\n      admitted the correctness of the schedules prepared by the\n      Respondent\, which set out the quantum of the amounts withheld\,\n      but not remitted.\n \nPART II\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE POINTS IN ISSUE\n \n12.         The sole issue is\n      whether or not the quantum of the assessments dated October 1\,\n      1999\, January 17\, 2000 and January 20\, 2000 is correct. In light\n      of the Appellant's admission\, the Respondent respectfully\n      submits that there is no question that the assessments are\n      correct.\n \n...\n \nB.          The\n      Appellant is liable to remit to the Minister amounts it withheld\n      from its employees at source\n\n \n\n \n16.         This portion of the\n      argument refers to provisions of the Income Tax Act. With regard\n      to Employment Insurance and Canada Pension\, there are parallel\n      provisions in the applicable legislation that are footnoted and\n      included in the Respondent's authorities.\n \n17.         In general terms\,\n      every person paying salary and wages and various other amounts\n      shall deduct or withhold a prescribed amount therefrom and\n      remit it to the Receiver General.[1]\n \n18.         Subsection 227(1) of\n      the Income Tax Act ensures that no action lies against an\n      employer who deducts or withholds a portion of an employee's\n      wage in compliance\, or in intended compliance\, with the\n      Act.[2]\n \n19.         The Income Tax\n      Act views different failures in different ways. It\n      distinguishes between a failure to withhold and a failure to\n      remit amounts that were withheld. A summary of the principles\n      applying to withholding and remitting is contained in the\n      judgment of the Federal Court of Appeals in Coopers  & \n      Lybrand Ltd. v. R:\n \nSection 227(1) deals with two distinctly different defaults by\n      persons paying wages. First\, the failure to deduct and\, second\,\n      the failure to remit the amount deducted. The liability imposed\n      in each of these instances is more easily understood if one keeps\n      in mind that when a deduction for income tax is made from\n      wages the employee is deemed to have received\, as wages\, the\n      amount deducted and is accorded credit for the amount\n      deducted as an installment on account of the income tax to\n      become due with respect to his income.\n \nIf the person paying fails to deduct\, his failure has no\n      effect on the liability of the employee for income tax it being\n      assumed that the taxing authority will recover from the employee\n      the full amount of the income tax; the only liability incurred by\n      the person paying the salary or wage is a penalty calculated as a\n      percentage of the amount he has failed to deduct.\n\n                   \nOn the other hand if a deduction is actually made and the\n      amount deducted not fully remitted the person making the\n      deduction becomes liable to the collector for the amount the\n      employee is deemed to have received as his salary and credit is\n      given to the employee on account of income tax for an amount\n      equal to the amount deducted. In this latter event the liability\n      of the person paying\, over and above the 10% penalty which may be\n      assessed on account of his default in remitting is an amount\n      equal to the deductions he had failed to remit together\, with\n      interest thereon.(Emphasis added)\n \nCoopers  &  Lybrand Ltd. v. R.\, 80 D.T.C.\n6281 (Fed. C.A.) at 6287 [TAB 8]\n \nThe appeal at bar involves the latter situation. Clearly\,\n      given that the Appellant has admitted withholding the amounts set\n      out in paragraph 10(g) of the Amended Reply in the General\n      Procedure appeal\, there is an indisputable obligation on the\n      Appellant to remit these amounts to the Receiver General of\n      Canada.\n \n20.         It should also be\n      noted that the Appellant paid\, and its employees received\, a full\n      wage\, consisting of the net pay that the employees received and\n      the amount withheld at source. Under subsection 153(3) of the\n      Income Tax Act\, amounts deducted or withheld are deemed received\n      by the employee at the time of deduction or withholding.[3] Importantly\, each\n      employee was entitled to receive credits for the amounts that the\n      Appellant withheld.\n \n21.         The Appellant's\n      logical and legal imbalance is its apparent argument that\n      employees who might receive refunds are not taxable and\,\n      therefore\, the employer need not make withholdings at source.\n      This is wrong. These employees are taxable and it is the\n      employer's obligation to withhold that tax (and the other\n      deductions). In any event\, the appeal at bar does not concern a\n      failure to withhold\, but a failure to remit. The Appellant cannot\n      avoid its obligation to remit by arguing that it should not have\n      withheld. Simply put: amounts that have been withheld must be\n      remitted.\n \nC.          Even\n      if the Appellant made a mathematical error in the amounts it\n      withheld\, which is denied\, the Appellant is still obligated to\n      remit the amounts it withheld\n\n \n\n \n22.         Subsection 227(4) of\n      the Income Tax Act stipulates that amounts deducted or\n      withheld under the Act (such as employees' source\n      deductions) are deemed to be held in trust for Her Majesty and\n      for payment to Her Majesty in accordance with the Act.\n      The amounts deducted or withheld are deemed to be held separate\n      and apart from the property of the person withholding or\n      deducting the amounts.[4]\n \n23.         Furthermore\,\n      subsection 227(9.4) of the Income Tax Act states that a\n      person who has failed to remit\, as and when required by the\n      Act or a regulation\, an amount deducted or withheld from a\n      payment to another person is liable to pay as tax under the\n      Act the amount so deducted or withheld on behalf of the\n      other person.\n \n24.         Finally\, in a\n      technical note published in 1988\, it is pointed out that\n      subsection 227(9.4) restates the obligation to remit an amount\n      deducted or withheld as provided in subsection 153(1).[5] Subsection 227(9.4)\, in\n      conjunction with subsection 227(10.1)\, enables the Minister to\n      assess the unremited source deductions against the person who\n      fails to remit\, together with interest and penalties in respect\n      thereof.[6]\n \n25.         Accordingly\,\n      regardless of the mathematical correctness of the Appellant's\n      own calculations\, whatever quantum it withheld is held in trust\n      for the Minister and must be remitted. If the Appellant refuses\n      to do so\, assessments can be raised against it for the full\n      amount that it failed to remit.\n \n...\n \n \nPART IV\n \nORDER SOUGHT\n \n33.         The Respondent\n      requests that a judgment issue determining that the Appellant was\n      correctly assessed for amounts withheld\, but not remitted\, from\n      July\, 1999 to December\, 1999 in the amount of $44\,566.50\, with\n      costs to the Respondent in the General Procedure appeal.\n \nFinal Argument of Aboriginal Federated Alliance\n      Inc.\n \n1.           Aboriginal\n      Federated Alliance Inc. [hereinafter referred to as Aboriginal\n      Federated] carried on business providing fire fighting services\n      in the Fort McMurray area in the summer of 1999 and 2000. These\n      tax appeals are for 2000-4194(IT)G\, 2000-4200(EI)\, and\n      2000-4201(CPP) ... 2000-5210(IT)I\, 2000-5208(EI) and\n      2000-5209(CPP) ... An Order of the Tax Court of Canada was issued\n      on August 12\, 2002 directing that all of these appeals be set\n      down for hearing on the same day.\n \n\n                   \n      Order of August 12\, 2002. [Tab 1]\n \n2.           The majority of\n      persons who were employed by Aboriginal Federated were either\n      status Indians or persons who had applied for status. Most of\n      these aboriginals were adherents to Treaty No. 8. These\n      aboriginal persons were involved in traditional land use\n      activities including hunting and fishing and these fire-services\n      were in the areas where these traditional activities occurred.\n      They were familiar with these land areas. Many of these persons\n      are ""homeless"" being unable to afford housing in the\n      Fort McMurray area. These fire fighting services performed by\n      Aboriginal Federated were paid for pursuant to contracts made\n      with Alberta Forestry/Environment.\n \n\n                   \n      Testimony of John Malcolm\n \n3.           By Order of\n      the Tax Court of Canada dated May 12\, 2003\, this hearing is to\n      deal with the issue of quantum only and the constitutional issue\n      respecting the taxation of aboriginals under Treaty No. 8\n      is held in abeyance pending the decision of Benoit by the\n      Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court of Appeal has given\n      judgment in the Benoit appeal however\, the status of an\n      appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada has not yet been\n      determined.\n \n\n                                           \n      Order of May 12\, 2003. [Tab 2]\n \n[4]       Note that in both this Argument of\n      Aboriginal Federated Alliance Inc. and in the Respondent's\n      Submissions there are references to decisions of the Court of\n      Queen's Bench of Alberta and a judgment of the Alberta Court\n      of Appeal. The gist of these judgments is that they determine\n      that it is the Tax Court of Canada that has jurisdiction to\n      determine the quantum of the assessments in question.\n \n[5]       Note also that the Final Argument\n      of Aboriginal Federated Alliance Inc. and the Respondent's\n      Written Submissions both make reference to an annual CPP\n      exemption of $3500 and to the basic personal exemption for income\n      tax. The Appellant's counsel argues after discussing the\n      above that the amount in question should be reduced to\n      $17\,024.59. In my view the submissions of counsel for the\n      Respondent are correct and the true amount in issue is\n      $44\,566.50.\n \nAnalysis\n \n[6]       In my opinion I have concluded\n      that the Respondent's Written Submissions are correct and\n      consequently I find that the Appellant was correctly assessed for\n      amounts withheld but not remitted from July 1999 to December 1999\n      in the amount of $44\,566.50. Costs are awarded to the Respondent\n      in the General Procedure appeal. It is to be observed that the\n      Supreme Court of Canada on April 29\, 2004 refused to hear\n      the appeal of the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal\n      inCharles John Gordon Benoit et al v. The Queen\, with the\n      result that the argument of the Appellant based on certain\n      Aboriginals being adherents to Treaty No. 8 fails.\n \nSigned at Ottawa\, Canada\, this 11th day of May 2004.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n""T.

L. McMurray\, dated September 26\, 1996\, wherein it was determined that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for the processing of the applicant's application for landing from within Canada.\n      The applicant seeks an Order quashing the said decision\, and a further Order requiring the respondent to process the application for landing from within Canada in accordance with the policy provisions set out in section IE 9 of the Immigration Manual.\nTHE FACTS\n      The applicant is a citizen of India. He came to Canada on March 17\, 1991 and made a claim to Convention refugee status. The Convention Refugee Determination Division [hereinafter\, ""CRDD""] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [hereinafter\, ""IRB""] determined the applicant not to be a Convention refugee.\n      The applicant submitted an application\, dated May 13\, 1996\, to be allowed to apply for permanent residence from within Canada [hereinafter\, ""H  &  C application""]. On September 12\, 1996\, Paulette M. Johnson\, an immigration officer\, interviewed the applicant. During this interview\, the applicant claimed to continue to fear persecution in India due to a number of events that had occurred subsequent to the rejection of his claim to refugee status. These events are listed in the applicant's Memorandum of Law. The immigration officer formed the opinion that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds in the applicant's case to warrant granting subsection 114(2) relief. She recommended that the applicant's application be refused\, and the immigration officer's manager concurred in her recommendation on September 24\, 1996.\n      In the immigration officer's notes regarding the interview\, under the concluding section entitled\, ""Officers Recommendations / Decision and Rationale\,"" she indicates\, in the first of three paragraphs\, as follows:\n\n \n              \nSukhmandar [sic] Sandhu is a failed Refugee claimant who has also has [sic] a negative PCDO decision. He is presently awaiting his PDRCC review as well as the outcome of an appeal against his PCDO decision. A section 20 Report was written against Mr Sandhu in 1991 but it appears no order was ever issued against him.\n              \n\n \n      The second paragraph of this section refers to the applicant's employment history\, community involvement\, and family connections in Canada and in India. The third paragraph simply contains the officer's suggestion that there are insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds in this case\, and that the application be directed to inquiry.\n      However\, the applicant was not entitled to a PDRCC review\, as his refugee claim had been refused prior to February 1\, 1993\, the date when the PDRCC regulations were promulgated. In addition\, although the immigration officer had the discretion to consult with a PDRCC officer concerning risk\, but no such consultation was made.\n THE ISSUES\n\n \n1.      Did the immigration officer fail to consider the applicant's stated fear of returning to India? That is\, did the immigration officer fail to consider relevant evidence?\n\n \n\n \n2.      Did the immigration officer make erroneous findings of fact in her reasons in referring to the applicant's negative PCDO decision\, an appeal of the negative PCDO decision\, and an upcoming PDRCC review\, when none of these facts exist in the applicant's case? If so\, were the erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before her?\n\n \nDISCUSSION\n\n \n1.      The applicant's stated fear of returning to India \n\n \nThe evidence\n      In her notes regarding the interview\, the immigration officer indicates that the applicant provided the following information regarding the individual merits of his case:\n\n \n              \n... Also claims he fears returning to India as he was arrested and tortured along with his father prior to coming to Canada. Claimed he was arrested in 1990 for supporting terrorist commando forces but that all he really did was to give food to this group and that he had no choice in the matter. He was not a member of the group neither was he or his family involved with them in any other way.\n              \n\n \nAnalysis\n      The above passage indicates that the immigration officer was well aware of the applicant's concerns relating to fear. Although she does not specifically refer to this fear in her recommendation\, it is evident that these concerns were before her. On the basis of the above passage\, I cannot conclude that the immigration officer failed to consider the applicant's fear of returning to India. The immigration officer did not fail to consider relevant evidence in this regard.\n\n \n2.      Erroneous findings of fact \n\n \nThe evidence\n      In the opening paragraph of the immigration officer's reasons / rationale quoted above\, she clearly refers to the applicant's negative PCDO decision\, an appeal of the negative PCDO decision\, and an upcoming PDRCC review. However\, none of these facts exist in the applicant's case.\n      The immigration officer deposes that the above reference to a PCDO decision was inadvertent. She had intended\, instead\, to indicate that the applicant had received a negative DROC (""Deferred Removal Orders Class"") decision and was awaiting the outcome of his appeal against the DROC decision.\n      With respect to the reference to the upcoming PDRCC review\, the immigration officer deposes that it is her practise to ask applicants who have had negative decisions with respect to their refugee claims\, if they have had a PDRCC review. She\, therefore\, asked the applicant whether he had had such a review\, and he responded in the negative. The immigration officer deposes that she merely assumed that the applicant was eligible for a PDRCC review and that he would receive one at a later date. The immigration officer further deposes that the PDRCC issue had no bearing on her decision\, as she had thoroughly reviewed and considered the applicant's allegation that his life would be in danger in India and found that this was not the case.\nAnalysis\n      Counsel to the applicant submits that it is inappropriate for the decision maker\, in this case the immigration officer\, to file an affidavit such as was filed.\n      An application for judicial review is\, except in very exceptional circumstances\, to be based solely on the record that was before the decision maker. The immigration officer's affidavit does not introduce any new evidence that was not before the decision maker. The immigration officer's affidavit serves a function not unlike the applicant's affidavit. I\, therefore\, find no problems with the admissibility of the immigration officer's affidavit.\n      As I have concluded above\, the immigration officer did consider the applicant's stated fear of return to India. However\, how did the erroneous findings of fact referred to above impact on the immigration officer's ultimate decision?\n      The immigration officer deposes that she inadvertently referred to a PCDO\, when in fact she meant a DROC. On this isolated point\, I find the immigration officer's explanation to be plausible.\n      However\, the references to the PCDO must be examined in the context of the entire paragraph in which they are situated\, as well as in the context of the decision as a whole.\n      A preliminary observation is that\, if we accept that the immigration officer was really referring to the applicant's negative DROC decision\,1 then it is curious indeed that she thought that the applicant would also be receiving a PDRCC review. It is not correct that in the Immigration Act one may have both a DROC and a PDRCC review.\n      Even totally ignoring the DROC issue\, I also find it curious that the immigration officer thought that the applicant had an upcoming PDRCC review\, given that the evidence before the immigration officer was that the applicant's claim to Convention refugee status had been rejected on April 9\, 1992. Surely\, the immigration officer would have known that. The PDRCC regulations were promulgated on February 1\, 1993\, and the applicant's refugee claim had been rejected prior to that date. Surely\, the immigration officer would have known that the applicant was not entitled to a PDRCC review given these facts.\n      Inadvertent or typographical errors do not\, in most instances\, go to the merits of a case\, and are not\, therefore\, sufficient grounds for judicial intervention in an immigration officer's decision. A decision maker's apparent unfamiliarity with the fact situation or legislation before her\, however\, can be good grounds\, indeed\, for judicial intervention.\n      But the above is not the heart of the problem with the immigration officer's decision. The most troubling aspect is found when the above errors are examined in the context of the decision as a whole.\n      The immigration officer deposes that she carefully assessed the danger of life\, severe sanctions or inhumane treatment posed to the applicant in his country of origin. However\, she was also under the impression that a PDRCC review would be conducted\, in which the issue of risk to the applicant would be considered.\n      Guidelines issued by the Department of Immigration (known as ""IE 9"") to immigration officers indicate that humanitarian or compassionate grounds exist when ""... unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be cause to the person seeking consideration ..."" upon departure from Canada.2 The guidelines provide examples of situations which may justify humanitarian or compassionate relief\, including the existence of severe sanctions in a person's country of origin. In the context of the three paragraph decision\, it is evident that the introductory paragraph is the only paragraph in which the immigration officer came to a conclusion about the issue of risk.\n      The wording of this paragraph indicates that the immigration officer believed that a PCDO decision\, in which such a risk assessment would have been made\, had been made\, and that the result was negative for the applicant. However\, there has been no such decision and no such risk assessment with respect to the applicant. The immigration officer has since clarified that the PCDO references were the result of an inadvertent errors.\n      The wording of this paragraph also indicates that the immigration officer believed that a PDRCC review\, in which a risk assessment would be made\, would be forthcoming. However\, no such review was forthcoming\, nor\, in the circumstances of this case\, can there be.\n      The immigration officer was thus under the erroneous impression that a risk assessment was somehow ""in the picture"" for this particular claimant. On this basis\, I can conclude that\, although the immigration officer was aware of the applicant's stated fears\, she did not actually make any decision as to whether those fears\, and the risks consequent thereon\, were reasonable or not in the applicant's particular situation. Although the immigration officer now deposes that she did come to the conclusion that there was no reasonable basis for the applicant's fears\, there is no indication at all in her notes that she actually did so. There is\, instead\, the implication that -- inadvertent error or not -- she believed that an appropriate risk assessment had\, or would\, be done in the case of the applicant.\n      The immigration officer's decision is a two-part decision. The first part of the decision is with respect to elements of risk\, as discussed above. The second part concerns the extent of the applicant's connections to Canada and to his home country. Thus\, in the context of the whole of the decision\, a significant portion of it is grounded in erroneous findings of fact. These erroneous findings of fact were made without regard for the material before the immigration officer\, which clearly indicated that no risk assessment been made\, nor would there be any forthcoming. In the circumstances of this case\, it was incumbent on the immigration officer to perform such a risk assessment.3 I am not convinced that she did this.\nCONCLUSION\n      This matter will be referred back to a different immigration officer for redetermination\, and that the policy provisions set out in section IE 9 of the Immigration Manual explicitly be taken into account in that redetermination.\nOTTAWA\, ONTARIO      \n      \nSeptember 11\, 1997.

On April 4\, 1998\, he eluded examination by escaping from the vessel prior to being examined by an immigration officer.\n[3]      On April 8\, 1998\, the applicant reported to Immigration Canada for the purpose of making a refugee claim.1 The applicant was then given by Immigration Officer Beaver a form to fill out called ""notification of claim to be Convention refugee"".2 On April 16\, 1998\, in a document entitled ""subsection 27(2) Highlights""\, the same immigration officer recommended that "". . . the subject be referred to a S.I.O. so as to determine his eligibility to make a refugee claim in Canada"" and stated that ""[i]t appears the subject is eligible to make a refugee claim in Canada"".\n[4]      Since his arrival in Canada\, the applicant had been staying at a shelter in Vancouver called Welcome House. At the end of April\, 1998\, he was told he could no longer stay there and his belongings were put outside. Depressed\, confused and not knowing of any other place where to go\, on May 1\, 1998\, the applicant attended at the Immigration Enforcement Office in Vancouver and told Immigration Officer Beaver that he wanted to leave Canada and go back to Iraq. He signed a paper stating that he did ""not want to continue [his] refugee claim due to general problems that [he was] facing"".3 The immigration officer noted on the applicant's Notification of Claim Form: ""Does not want to make claim. Not referred to S.I.O.""4 However\, on the same day\, a senior immigration officer issued a departure order against the applicant\, requiring him to leave Canada within 30 days.\n[5]      The applicant told his lawyer what he had done only after the fact. He soon changed his mind and on May 4\, 1998\, he told both his lawyer and a removals officer during an interview that he was afraid to go back to Iraq and that he wanted to continue with his refugee claim. Subsequently\, the applicant changed lawyers.\n[6]      On December 10\, 1998\, having obtained the contents of the immigration file through the Privacy Act\, counsel for the applicant applied to Immigration Canada5 to have his client's claim for Convention refugee status reopened. The material submitted to Immigration Canada in support of this application included a report dated October 1\, 1998 from Dr. Wahin Wanis\, a psychiatrist at the Vancouver Hospital.\n[7]      On December 14\, 1998\, Removals Officer Mendel denied the application stating that the applicant "". . . is not entitled to an S.I.O. review for reopening of the refugee case"". After having summarized the chronological history of the case\, she wrote:\n\n \n""Seeing as the subject was not yet found to be eligible to make a Refugee claim\, he may not apply to have his claim reopened. A claim was never commenced\, only an intention to make a claim was filed.\n\n \n\n \nSubject was issued a Departure Order. Once issued\, this order is irreversible. A subject under a Deemed Deportation Order may not re-apply to become eligible to make a Refugee claim.""\n\n \n\n \n      (Decision maker's underlining)\n\n \n  [8]      In support of his application\, the applicant first submits that because he sought a determination of his refugee claim by notifying an immigration officer of his claim to be a Convention refugee on April 8\, 1998 (i.e. prior to any removal order having been made against him)\, he was entitled to have his claim referred to a senior immigration officer for a determination of eligibility.6 In so far as\, on December 10\, 1998\, he was seeking the reopening of a claim that was commenced before the removal order was made (May 1/98)\, the applicant contends that he is in a different situation from a person who having failed or declined to make a claim in a timely manner\, sought to have the removal order reopened so that a claim could be made.7\n[9]      The applicant also submits that the immigration officer's decision under review was a decision that should have been made by a senior immigration officer\, and consequently\, that it was made without jurisdiction. Alternatively\, he contends that if the immigration officer acted within jurisdiction\, she erred in two different ways: a) in finding that a refugee claim was never commenced and that only an intention to make a refugee claim was filed\, and b) in characterizing the matter before her as an application to re-apply to become eligible to make a refugee claim rather than as an application to reopen the refugee claim which had already been made.\n[10]      The respondent submits that the applicant is in the same position as if no claim had been made prior to a removal order being issued. As the applications to reopen are the exception to the functus officio principle\, the respondent submits that there is no decision here to which the functus officio principle could apply or to which the reopening exception could apply.8 Alternatively\, if there was a decision which could be the subject of an application to reopen\, the respondent submits that Section 44 of the Immigration Act contemplates that the issue of access to the refugee determination system is closed once a removal order is made.9\n[11]      Sections 44 and 45 of the Immigration Act read as follows:\n\n \n 44.(1) Any person who is in Canada\, other than a person against whom a removal order has been made but not executed\, unless an appeal from that order has been allowed\, and who claims to be a Convention refugee may seek a determination of the claim by notifying an immigration officer.\n\n 44.(1) Toute personne se trouvant au Canada peut revendiquer le statut de r_fugi_ au sens de la Convention en avisant en ce sens un agent d'immigration\, _ condition de ne pas _tre frapp_e d'une mesure de renvoi qui n'a pas _t_ ex_cut_e\, _ moins que la mesure n'ait _t_ annul_e en appel.\n\n\n \n\n \n (2) An immigration officer who is notified pursuant to subsection (1) shall forthwith refer the claim to a senior immigration officer.\n\n (2) Le cas _ch_ant\, l'agent d'immigration d_f_re sans d_lai le cas _ un agent principal.\n\n\n \n\n \n ... ... ...\n\n ... ... ...\n\n\n \n\n \n 45.(1) Where a person's claim to be a Convention refugee is referred to a senior immigration officer\, the senior immigration officer shall\n(a) subject to subsection (2)\, determine whether the person is eligible to have the claim determined by the Refugee Division; and\n(b) if the person is the subject of a report under subsection 20(1) or 27(1) or (2) or has been arrested pursuant to subsection 103(2)\, take the appropriate action referred to in any of subsections 23(4)\, (4.01) or (4.2) or 27(4) or (6) or section 28.\n\n 45.(1) L'agent principal _ qui le cas a _t_ d_f_r_ d_cide\, sous r_serve du paragraphe (2)\, de la recevabilit_ de la revendication; il doit en outre\, si l'int_ress_ fait l'objet d'un rapport en vertu des paragraphes 20(1) ou 27(1) ou (2) ou s'il a _t_ arr_t_ en vertu du paragraphe 103(2)\, prendre _ son encontre la mesure indiqu_e pr_vue aux paragraphes 23(4)\, (4.01) ou (4.2) ou 27(4) ou (6) ou _ l'article 28.\n    \n\n \n\n \n ... ... ...\n\n ... ... ...\n\n\n \n\n \n (3) On making a determination under paragraph (1)(a)\, the senior immigration officer shall notify the person in writing of the determination and\, where the person is determined not to be eligible to have a claim to be a Convention refugee referred to the Refugee Division\, shall include in the notification the basis for the determination.\n\n (3) L'agent principal avise par _crit l'int_ress_ de sa d_cision et\, lorsqu'elle lui est d_favorable\, doit la motiver _galement par _crit.\n       \n\n \n\n \n (4) The burden of proving that a person is eligible to have a claim to be a Convention refugee determined by the Refugee Division rests on the person.\n\n (4) Il appartient _ l'int_ress_ de prouver que sa revendication est recevable.\n \n\n \n\n \n (5) Every person who claims to be a Convention refugee shall truthfully provide such information as may be required by the senior immigration officer to whom the person's claim is referred for the purposes of determining whether the person is eligible to have the claim determined by the Refugee Division\, R.S.C. 1985 (4th Supp.)\, c.28\, s.14; S.C. 1992\, c.49\, s.35; S.C. 1995\, c.15\, s.8.\n\n (5) L'int_ress_ doit fournir _ l'agent principal les renseignements que celui-ci exige pour _tre en mesure de d_cider de la recevabilit_ de sa revendication du statut de r_fugi_ au sens de la Convention.

Pursuant to subsection 45(1)\, the senior immigration officer then had to ascertain whether the applicant was eligible to have the claim determined and\, insofar as he was the subject of a report under subsection 27(2) of the Act\, make a removal order against him.\n[14]      On December 10\, 1998\, the applicant applied to a senior immigration officer through his new counsel to have his claim for refugee status reopened.13 It is clear from this letter that the applicant wanted to have the decision not to refer his case to a senior immigration officer reconsidered and his initial claim for refugee status reopened so that it would eventually be determined by the Refugee Division. However\, it was an immigration officer and more specifically a removals officer14 who replied. On the pretext that a senior immigration officer had not yet determined whether the applicant was eligible to make a refugee claim and that a departure order had been issued\, the immigration officer denied the application to reopen his claim. This is the decision under review. In support of her decision\, she stated that a claim for refugee status was never commenced\, only an intention to make a claim was filed. She also stated that once a departure order is issued against a person\, that person may not re-apply to become eligible to make a refugee claim.\n[15]      In my view\, this decision must be set aside and the matter referred back to a senior immigration officer for determination.\n[16]      The immigration officer erred in considering the application dated December 10\, 1998\, a new claim for refugee status when it was clearly - the terms of the letter are unequivocal - an application to have his initial claim reopened.\n[17]      But what is more\, I believe that the immigration officer erred in deciding that the applicant was not entitled to a review of his application to reopen his claim by a senior immigration officer. In the instant case\, the applicant had in fact made a claim for refugee status and not simply expressed his intention to do so. At that point\, Immigration Officer Beaver was required under the Act to forthwith refer the claim to a senior immigration officer\, which he failed to do. In my view\, under the terms of subsection 45(1) of the Act\, only a senior immigration officer could determine whether the applicant was "". . . eligible to have the claim determined by the Refugee Division"". I also believe that only a senior immigration officer could make a decision on the application to have the claim reopened. In acting as he did\, the immigration officer assumed the jurisdiction of a senior immigration officer.\n[18]      Even if we were to assume that the immigration officer had jurisdiction to make a decision on the application to have the claim reopened\, I believe he erred in making that decision. The applicant had in fact made a claim for refugee status and nowhere in the Immigration Act is there a reference to a matter that is less than an actual claim to refugee status which could be characterized as ""only an intent to make a claim"". These errors warrant the intervention of the Court.\n[19]      The applicant suggested that the two following questions be certified for the purposes of an appeal in accordance with subsection 83(1) of the Immigration Act:\n \n \n1.      Is an immigration officer required to refer an application to re-open a refugee claim to an S.I.O. where the claim was initiated prior to the issuance of a removal order but the claimant has withdrawn the claim\, and where the claimant now seeks to re-open the claim based on new psychiatric evidence\, after a removal order has been issued?;\n\n \nand\n\n \n2.      Does a Senior Immigration Officer have jurisdiction to consider the eligibility of a refugee claim pursuant to section 45 of the Act\, if the refugee claim was initiated prior to the issuance of a removal order\, but not referred to the S.I.O. until after the removal order was issued?\n\n \nIt may appear inappropriate to certify these questions as the Court is setting aside the decision under review. However\, as the legal issue is not yet settled and a serious question of general importance is involved\, the questions should be certified.\n                               _________________________\n                              Judge\n  Ottawa\, Ontario\nNovember 22\, 1999\n __________________        1      ""Acknowledgement of Convention Refugee claim"" dated April 9\, 1998\, at page 17 of the Applicant's Record (""AR"").\n       2      AR\, p. 18.

According to the applicant\, he noticed that a departure order had been prepared. His consultant requested that the senior immigration officer consider the reinstatement of his visitor status for a short time. The immigration officer\, again according to the applicant\, ""... simply stated that he was no longer a bona fide visitor"" and refused to explain further this statement.\n\n \n\n \n[6]      The applicant was asked to sign the departure order and did so.7 \n\n \n\n \n[7]      While in Canada\, the applicant was attempting to have processed his application for permanent residence through the Canadian consulate in Detroit\, Michigan. The lapse of his visitor status had prevented the applicant from attending his interview scheduled for July 21\, 1998. That interview was re-scheduled for November 23\, 1998.\n\n \n\n \n[8]      In this proceeding\, the applicant seeks judicial review of (a) the decision of the Deputy Minister""s representative\, made on August 18\, 1998\, directing a senior immigration officer to make a determination pursuant to subsection 27(4); and (b) the decision of the senior immigration officer to issue the departure order. The applicant""s challenge focussed principally\, if not solely\, on the second decision.\n\n \nANALYSIS\n\n \n[9]      The applicant""s first argument is based on the call-in-notice for the interview of August 18\, 1998. In his view\, this notice triggered a somewhat higher duty on the senior immigration officer to adhere to the principles of fairness and natural justice in reaching the subsection 27(4) decision concerning the departure order. He also argues that the call-in-notice should have made specific reference to the possible issuance of a departure order under subsection 27(4). In addition\, according to the applicant\, the occasion of the interview required the senior immigration officer to provide the applicant with an opportunity to make submissions. For the respondent\, the senior immigration officer""s decision to issue the departure order on August 18\, 1998 was a purely administrative one and the only possible decision since the applicant""s visa status had expired on March 6\, 1998.\n\n \n\n \n[10]      In the circumstances of this case and on the evidence before me\, I find no reviewable error in the decision of the senior immigration officer to issue the departure order. According to subparagraph 27(4)(b)(ii)\, the departure order ""shall"" be made if the senior immigration officer is satisfied that the person is one described in paragraphs 27(2)(e ) and 26(1)(c) or\, in other words\, a person who remained in Canada after ceasing to be a visitor. This determination was open to the senior immigration officer on the basis of the documentary record. The refusal of the visitor status extension on June 30\, 1998 had not been challenged by way of judicial review. The departure order could have been issued without any interview.\n\n \n\n \n[11]      In my opinion\, the invitation to the interview did not significantly\, if at all\, affect the duty of fairness. I infer\, in these circumstances\, that the purpose of the call-in-notice was to have the applicant sign the departure order.8 In any event\, on his own evidence\, the applicant and the consultant accompanying him requested that the senior immigration officer ""... should reconsider reinstating my visitor status for a short time only\, enabling me to attend the interview for permanent status in Canada.""9 On the basis of this assertion\, I am satisfied that the applicant was provided with an opportunity\, without deciding that he had any such right\, to make further submissions concerning the extension of his visitor""s status.\n\n \n\n \n[12]      The applicant""s second argument must also be rejected. The burden was on the applicant to make a formal application for a minister""s permit or for humanitarian and compassionate consideration\, pursuant to subsections 27(2) and 114(2) of the Act respectively. There was no requirement on the senior immigration officer to take these issues into consideration in making the subsection 27(4) determination to issue the departure order.\n\n \n\n \n[13]      For these reasons\, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.\n\n \n\n \n[14]      The applicant has suggested the certification of the following questions:\n\n \n\n \n      When a senior immigration officer is making a determination in the context of section 27 of the Immigration Act\, does that officer have an obligation to inform the applicant of the specific allegation against him in the report?\n          \n\n \n\n \n      In the same context\, does the senior immigration officer have an obligation to verify the truthfulness of the allegations against the applicant?\n          \n\n \n\n \n      In the same context\, does the senior immigration officer have an obligation to provide the applicant with an opportunity to reply to the allegations?\n          \n\n \n[15]      I agree with the submissions of the respondent""s counsel that the facts of this case are such that none of the three questions would be dispositive of an appeal. It is common ground that the applicant""s visitor status had lapsed. He knew this before and during the meeting of August 18\, 1998. Submissions were made that his visitor status be extended. Accordingly\, there is no factual basis to support the issues raised in the questions suggested by the applicant. The questions do not raise a serious issue of general importance and none will be certified.\n      ""Allan Lutfy""\n      J.F.C.C.\nToronto\, Ontario\nJune 30\, 1999\n              \n      FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA\n      Names of Counsel and Solicitors of Record\nCOURT NO:                          IMM-4545-98\n\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                      ANDRIY MARKHEVKA\n\n \n                                          \n\n \n                              - and -\n\n \n\n \n                              THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\n \nDATE OF HEARING:                  TUESDAY\, JUNE 15\, 1999\nPLACE OF HEARING:                  TORONTO\, ONTARIO\nREASONS FOR ORDER BY:              LUTFY J.\n\n \n DATED:                          WEDNESDAY\, JUNE 30\, 1999\n\n \n APPEARANCES:                      Mr. Max Chaudhary\n                                  For the Applicant\n                              Ms. Sally Thomas\n                                  For the Respondent\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD:              Chaudhary Law Office\n                              Barristers  &  Solicitors\n                              405-255 Duncan Mill Road\n                              North York\, Ontario\n                              M3B 3H9\n                              \n                                  For the Applicant\n\n \n                              Morris Rosenberg\n\n \n                              Deputy Attorney General\n                              of Canada\n              \n                                  For the Respondent\n                               FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA\n                                  Date: 19990630\n                          \n          Docket: IMM-4545-98\n                              Between:\n\n \n                              \n\n \n\n \n                               ANDRIY MARKHEVKA \n\n \n      Applicant\n\n \n                              - and -\n\n \n\n \n                               THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION \n\n \n\n \n                              \n\n \n      Respondent\n                      \n                              \n              \n                                                                           REASONS FOR ORDER\n                              \n __________________ 1      Applicant""s application record\, p. 37.\n2      Applicant""s application record\, p. 56.

JUSTICE O'KEEFE\n \nBETWEEN:\nGURMUKH SINGH BANSAL\nApplicant\n \n- and -\n \nTHE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nRespondent\n \n \nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT AND JUDGMENT\n \nO'KEEFE J.\n[1]                 This is an application for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer\, dated March 21\, 2005\, which refused to grant the applicant an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (H  &  C) grounds to permit inland processing of his permanent residence application.\n \n[2]                 The applicant seeks an order quashing the immigration officer's decision and remitting the matter for redetermination by a different immigration officer.\n \nBackground\n \n[3]                 Gurmukh Singh Bansal (the applicant)\, a citizen of India\, has been living in Canada since January 1998. In February 1998\, a removal order was issued for the applicant. The applicant subsequently made a refugee claim and a permanent residence application\, both of which were unsuccessful\, and he also received a negative risk assessment from a post-claim determination officer.\n \n[4]                 In January 2001\, the applicant filed an H  &  C application based on his establishment in Canada and the risk of persecution and risk to life if returned to India. On March 21\, 2005\, an immigration officer denied the H  &  C application. This is the judicial review of that decision.\n \n \n  Reasons for the Immigration Officer's Decision\n \n[5]                 The immigration officer stated that she had reviewed the applicant's submissions on establishment in Canada\, including proof of his savings and house and business ownership\, and letters of recommendation from friends and community leaders indicating that the applicant attends temple and volunteers in community events. The evidence showed that the applicant\, an electrician by trade\, is a director of and has a 25 percent share in one of three related companies which manufacture tube line assemblies for the heating\, venting and air conditioning industry. The applicant also works as an employee overseeing the maintenance of machines in all three companies.\n \n[6]                 The immigration officer noted that the applicant had purchased a house\, was part owner of a business and had acquired some savings. However\, she also noted that the applicant purchased the house and made business arrangements while he had no status in Canada. The immigration officer stated that permanent residence applications based solely on business are an important part of the immigration program and as such\, have their own assessment criteria.\n \n \n[7]                 In addition\, the immigration officer noted that the applicant had resided for at least eight years in India before coming to Canada\, and that he provided support for his wife and two children who are all residing in India. The immigration officer was not satisfied that the two children would not benefit from the applicant's presence and personal care and guidance if he were to return to India. She stated that the applicant's savings could be used to support himself and his family during the transition period upon his return to India. He would further be assisted by the training and experience he gained during his stay in Canada. The immigration officer stated that it was natural for the applicant to make friends\, form attachments and be gainfully employed during the seven years that he was living in Canada. The immigration officer concluded\, ""The applicant has not satisfied me that his ties to Canada are any more or less important than his ties to his country of origin.""\n \n[8]                 The immigration officer noted the applicant's argument that his prolonged inability to leave Canada has led to his establishment. However\, the immigration officer found that the applicant had not demonstrated that he was unable to leave Canada after his refugee claim and permanent residence application were refused. The immigration officer therefore found that the applicant's prolonged stay in Canada was not due to circumstances beyond his control.\n[9]                 Further\, the immigration officer found that the applicant's stated fear of persecution in his country of origin was an insufficient reason to approve the application. The immigration officer stated that she had read the risk opinion and was satisfied that the opinion was reasonable.\n \n[10]             As a result\, the immigration officer concluded that the applicant would not face undue\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he were to apply for a permanent resident visa in the normal manner from outside Canada.\n \nIssues\n \n[11]             The parties submitted the following issues:\n              1.          Did the immigration officer err in failing to carefully consider the factors of establishment in accordance with the immigration policy guidelines?\n              2.          Did the immigration officer err in ignoring or misinterpreting the evidence?\n \n  Applicant's Submissions\n \n[12]             The applicant submitted that the immigration officer failed to give a meaningful consideration of the applicant's evidence of establishment in accordance with the immigration policy guidelines. The applicant relied on Raudales v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2003 FCT 385 and Jamrich v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2003 FCT 804. In both of these decisions\, the Federal Court allowed the applications for judicial review of the negative H  &  C determinations because the immigration officers' conclusion that the applicants had not established themselves any more than as would be expected of individuals in similar circumstances was a patently unreasonable finding of fact in light of the evidence of the applicants' significant degree of establishment.\n \n[13]             The applicant submitted that the immigration officer's conclusion that the applicant could have left Canada was made without regard for the evidence. The applicant submitted that he had co-operated with immigration officials and was unable to leave Canada as he lacked the necessary travel documents.\n \n \n[14]             The applicant submitted that the fact that the applicant had no legal status in Canada was an irrelevant consideration given that all H  &  C applications are made by those who have no legal status in Canada.\n \n[15]             The applicant submitted that the immigration officer ignored the evidence of the vital role that the applicant played in his business. The applicant relied on Pramauntanyath v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 FC 604. In that case\, the applicant had come to Canada on a student visa\, overstayed his visa\, and opened a restaurant of which he was the main chef and one-third owner. Justice Phelan allowed the application for judicial review of the applicant's negative H  &  C determination because the immigration officer's decision did not give real reasons to address the critical plank of the applicant's argument\, which was that his presence in Canada was critical to the ongoing success of the restaurant and his removal would adversely affect himself\, his business and his partners and employees. In the case at bar\, the applicant submitted that similar facts have been established. There was no analysis in the immigration officer's reasons of the impact of the removal of the applicant on his business\, partners and employees despite the applicant's evidence that his removal would be a major setback for the business as it would have difficulties finding a replacement for the applicant.\n[16]             The applicant thus submitted that the immigration officer's decision was unreasonable and should be set aside.\n \nRespondent's Submissions\n \n[17]             The respondent submitted that any failure by the immigration officer to follow policy guidelines is not a reviewable error (see Vidal v. Canada(Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991)\, 41 F.T.R. 118 (T.D.)).\n \n[18]             The respondent submitted that the immigration officer's reasons demonstrated that she considered the degree of establishment advanced by the applicant. The respondent submitted that the applicant cannot rely on the Raudales and Jamrich decisions because the level of establishment alleged by the applicant is the normal establishment that could be foreseen in a person who has resided in Canada for seven years.\n \n[19]             The respondent submitted that there is no evidence that the applicant could not have left Canada after his refugee application and permanent residence application were refused. The respondent submitted that it was therefore open to the immigration officer to find that the applicant's prolonged stay in Canada was not due to circumstances beyond his control.\n \n[20]             The respondent submitted that the applicant made a business investment knowing that it may be lost because of his lack of status. Thus\, it was submitted that the immigration officer did not err in relying on the applicant's lack of status when assessing whether the potential loss of his investment qualified as undue hardship.\n \n[21]             The respondent submitted that unlike the situation in Pramauntanyath\, the immigration officer did assess the central thesis of the applicant's H  &  C application in respect of the business interests. However\, the immigration officer did not find this to be a persuasive factor. The respondent submitted that the immigration officer provided a cogent explanation for her decision in this regard.\n \n[22]             The respondent submitted that the applicant has not shown that the immigration officer ignored evidence in making her decision.\n \n  Relevant Statutory Provisions\n \n[23]             An H  &  C application is permitted under section 25 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27\, which provides:\n\n\n\n 25. (1) The Minister shall\, upon request of a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act\, and may\, on the Minister's own initiative\, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them\, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected\, or by public policy considerations.\n \n \n(2) The Minister may not grant permanent resident status to a foreign national referred to in subsection 9(1) if the foreign national does not meet the province's selection criteria applicable to that foreign national.\n\n  \n\n 25. (1) Le ministre doit\, sur demande d'un _tranger interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas _ la pr_sente loi\, et peut\, de sa propre initiative\, _tudier le cas de cet _tranger et peut lui octroyer le statut de r_sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des crit_res et obligations applicables\, s'il estime que des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire relatives _ l'_tranger - compte tenu de l'int_r_t sup_rieur de l'enfant directement touch_ - ou l'int_r_t public le justifient.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Le statut ne peut toutefois _tre octroy_ _ l'_tranger vis_ au paragraphe 9(1) qui ne r_pond pas aux crit_res de s_lection de la province en cause qui lui sont applicables.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis and Decision\n[24]             The appropriate standard of review for a decision of an immigration officer on an H  &  C application is reasonableness simpliciter (see Baker v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at 857 to 858).\n \n[25]             Issue 1\n              Did the immigration officer err in failing to carefully consider the factors of establishment in accordance with the immigration policy guidelines?\n              The officer's decision stated in part:\n. . . The applicant indicates he would also like his application to be considered based on ""a prolonged inability to leave Canada has led to establishment"". I note that although the applicant has\, indeed been in Canada for a prolonged period of time\, his stay has not been due to a situation beyond his control. As previously indicated\, the applicant indicates his refugee claim was not approved and his first application for permanent residence was also denied. The applicant has not satisfied me that he was unable to leave Canada since those two (2) applications were refused. The applicant has\, therefore\, not satisfied me that his case falls within the situations cited as an acceptable reason to approve this application.\n \n[26]             The applicant's submissions in a letter dated May 7\, 2001 contain the following:\nMr. Bansal is clearly successfully established in Canada. He meets the establishment guidelines. He has been successfully employed\, has accumulated almost 14\,000.00 in savings has a good civil record and has taken upgrading and training courses. He is unable to leave Canada despite the negative finding of his refugee claim because he does not have a passport and therefore is unable to effect his departure. He is cooperating with Removals in arranging his departure but has been unable to obtain a passport.\nIn light of this\, he qualifies for consideration under the establishment guidelines and IP5\, section 6.2\, pursuant to section 8.7 of the guidelines. According to the guidelines when considering whether or not Mr. Bansal is successfully established in Canada one must look at the following . . .\n \nAs noted above he is unable to leave the country at this time due to his inability to obtain a passport. As such he falls under the 8.7\, i.e. ""prolonged inability to leave"" category and also under the 8.12 other cases.\n \n[27]             References to the applicant's inability to obtain a passport are also made in later letters to the respondent. The record does not contain any evidence to the contrary.\n \n[28]             The current IP5 (Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds) contains the following provisions:\n5.21      Prolonged stay in Canadahas led to establishment\n \nPositive consideration may be warranted when the applicant has been in Canada for a significant period of time due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.\n \nThe following table may assist in clarifying circumstances beyond the applicant's control:\n \n \n\n\n\n Circumstances beyond the applicant's control\n \nIf general country conditions are considered unsafe due to war\, civil unrest\, etc.\, CIC may temporarily suspend removals to that country; when the conditions improve\, removals can resume. However\, situations may arise where suspension or removals continues for a number of years and there is no other viable destination option for the applicant. If it is unlikely that conditions will improve soon and the situation of no alternative destination continues\, this could reasonably be considered a hardship due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.\n\n  \n\n Circumstances not beyond the applicant's control\n \nAn applicant in Canada for a number of years is unwilling to sign a passport application or provide particulars for a passport application. In such a case\, inability to leave Canada is not considered beyond the control of the applicant and could reasonably be viewed as a very strong negative factor.\n\n\n\n\n \nWhen the period of inability to leave due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control is of significant duration and where there is evidence of a significant degree of establishment in Canada\, these factors may combine to warrant a favourable H  &  C decision.\n \n13.9      Prolonged inability to leave Canadahas led to establishment\n \nThere is no hard and fast rule relating to the period of time in Canada but it is expected that a significant degree of establishment would take several years to achieve.\n \nThese applicants may or may not be the subject of a removal order\, or may or may not have had a negative refugee determination and/or a post-claim review.\n \nOfficers should consider the following factors:\n \nAre the circumstances that led to the applicant remaining in Canada of significant duration and beyond their control?\n \nIs there a significant degree of establishment in Canada? (See Section 11.2\, Assessing the applicant's degree of establishment in Canada).\n \nIs the applicant in Canada because of a temporary suspension of removals to their country and is there another viable destination option? (Contact the local removals unit for assistance with this information).\n \nTo what degree has the applicant cooperated with the Department\, particularly with regard to travel documents?\n \nDid the applicant willfully lose or destroy travel documents? (When no valid travel or identity document has been provided\, contact the local removals unit to determine whether this is due to an applicant's unwillingness to complete a passport application).\n \nAny other factors relevant to the H  &  C decision.\n \n[29]             These previous factors make it obvious that a ""prolonged inability to leave Canada"" is a relevant factor in determining establishment of an applicant.\n \n[30]             The immigration officer in this case found that the applicant's stay in Canada has not been due to a situation beyond his control. The only evidence is contrary to this finding. The applicant could not get a passport. He also cooperated with the authorities. I am of the view that the immigration officer misapprehended the evidence. Since this evidence was relevant to the establishment of the applicant in Canada which in turn could effect the outcome of his H  &  C application\, the officer made a reviewable error.\n \n[31]             Because of my finding on Issue 1\, I need not deal with Issue 2.\n[32]             The application for judicial review is therefore allowed and the matter is remitted for redetermination by a different immigration officer.\n[33]             Neither party wished to have a serious question of general importance certified.\n \n \n  JUDGMENT\n \n[34]             IT IS ORDERED that the application for judicial review is allowed\, the immigration officer's decision is set aside and the matter is remitted for redetermination by a different immigration officer.\n \n \n""John A.

O'Keefe\n \nBETWEEN:\nLIDIA ORELLANA DELCID\nApplicant\n \n- and -\n \nTHE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nRespondent\n \n \nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT AND JUDGMENT\n \nO'KEEFE J.\n \n[1]                 This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 (IRPA) for judicial review of a decision by an immigration officer\, dated February 4\, 2005\, which refused to grant the applicant an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate (H  &  C) grounds to permit inland processing of her permanent residence application.\n \n[2]                 The applicant seeks an order quashing the immigration officer's decision and remitting the matter for re-determination by a different immigration officer.\n \nBackground\n \n[3]                 Lidia Orellana Del Cid (the applicant)\, a citizen of Guatemala\, came to Canada in October 1994 on a visitor visa. She left behind her husband and their two young daughters in Guatemala. Her intention was to be sponsored by her father\, a landed immigrant in Canada\, and then to bring the rest of her family to Canada. The applicant's visa expired in October 1995 but she has stayed in Canada continuously since her arrival.\n \n[4]                 While living in Canada\, the applicant worked as a cleaner and babysitter. She sent money back to Guatemala to pay for her daughters' schooling. She eventually separated from her Guatemalan husband and began living with her present husband\, Mr. Chamale\, who is a Canadian citizen. The applicant had two daughters in Canada with Mr. Chamale\, born October 1\, 1999 and March 7\, 2001. In the midst of this\, the applicant's Guatemalan husband died in a car accident in September 2000. The applicant married Mr. Chamale in May 2003.\n[5]                 The applicant currently stays at home to care for her two Canadian-born children while her husband works at a restaurant as a cook. The family lives in Mr. Chamale's brother's home along with Mr. Chamale's mother and grandfather.\n \n[6]                 The key events in the applicant's immigration file are as follows. The applicant made an H  &  C application in 1997\, which was refused in January 1998. She then made a refugee claim\, which was denied in April 2000.\n \n[7]                 In February 2001\, an immigration warrant for her arrest was issued for her failure to leave Canada and confirm her departure. In November 2003\, she was arrested by immigration officials and released on a cash bond.\n \n[8]                 On December 1\, 2003\, the applicant made a second H  &  C application based on the interests of her family in Canada. The applicant also submitted a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application\, which resulted in a negative risk assessment dated September 24\, 2004.\n \n[9]                 On February 4\, 2005\, an immigration officer denied the applicant's H  &  C application. This is the judicial review of that decision.\n \nReasons for the Immigration Officer's Decision\n \n[10]             The immigration officer considered the applicant's immigration history and found that the applicant had demonstrated a lack of respect and regard for Canadian immigration laws. Moreover\, the immigration officer found that the applicant had provided insufficient evidence that her actions were justified and due to reasons beyond her control.\n \n[11]             The immigration officer noted that the applicant had two daughters in Canada\, aged 3 and 5\, as well as two daughters in Guatemala\, aged 12 and 13. With respect to the interests of her children\, the immigration officer stated:\nThey now have two daughters\, Thelma and Damaris. Their daughters are aged five and three\, respectively. The applicant has a difficult choice ahead of her. She will either have to leave her children behind or take them with her. I will acknowledge that this will be a difficult decision for the applicant. I also acknowledge that the children may face difficult times in being away from either parent. I am not satisfied that their best interests will be jeopardized. They will have the love\, care and support of the custodial parent. That parent can ensure that the children will be well cared for and offer any support that is necessary to get through any difficulties the child may face.\n \nI cannot ignore the fact that the applicant built her new life during a time that she had no status in Canada. She remained in Canada long after the period authorized for her stay. She has created the situation in which she now finds herself. I further note that she has two other daughters remaining in Guatemala. Today\, they are 12 and 13. When the applicant left Guatemala\, they were two and three. They were no older than the Canadian born children are today; yet the applicant was able to leave them in Guatemala. I note that she has been separated from them for the past ten years. Undoubtedly the children in Guatemala are just as deserving of having the physical presence of their mother. I am not satisfied that she has demonstrated that the hardship faced by her Canadian born children would be any greater than the children who have been without their mother for the past ten years.\n \n \n[12]             The immigration officer also considered the applicant's degree of establishment in Canada. The immigration officer stated that the applicant ""had no employment history\, no upgrading or community involvement""\, and that the applicant had never been issued a work permit even though she was eligible to apply for one after submitting a refugee claim.\n \n[13]             With respect to the applicant's fear of returning to Guatemala\, the immigration officer noted that the applicant's relatives were killed in Guatemala and that the applicant has bad memories of Guatemala. However\, the immigration officer found that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant would be at risk if returned to Guatemala. The immigration officer was satisfied that the applicant had due process in this matter as the applicant had a negative PRRA and a negative refugee finding.\n \n[14]             The immigration officer refused the applicant's H  &  C application given that the applicant had not demonstrated that the requirement of applying for an immigrant visa outside of Canada constitutes unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.\n \nIssues\n \n[15]             The applicant submitted the following issues:\n              1.          Was the decision of the immigration officer unreasonable as it failed to be alive\, alert\, and attentive to the best interests of the applicant's children?\n              2.          Did the immigration officer err in failing to request and elicit additional information concerning the best interests of the applicant's children?\n \nApplicant's Submissions\n \n[16]             The applicant submitted that the central issue in this application is whether the decision of the immigration officer was reasonable. The applicant submitted that the immigration officer made an unreasonable decision because she gave\, at best\, cursory attention to the interests of the applicant's Canadian children. The immigration officer made no inquiries into the standard of living in Guatemala and the impact that the change in standard of living may have on the children if the applicant were to take them to Guatemala. Also\, the immigration officer made no inquiries on the language abilities of the children and the impact on their schooling. The applicant submitted that in light of Love v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FC 1569\, the immigration officer was required to make a more thorough analysis of the best interests of the children.\n \n[17]             The applicant submitted that it was incumbent on the immigration officer to seek and obtain better evidence concerning the interests of the children\, if she had insufficient evidence before her (see Cheema (Litigation Guardian) v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2002 FCT 638). The applicant submitted that the immigration officer should have made inquiries as to how the children would be cared for in Canada when their father is at work\, or the impact on the children's schooling without their mother.\n \nRespondent's Submissions\n[18]             The respondent submitted that there is no prima facie presumption that the children's best interests should prevail subject only to the gravest countervailing grounds (see Legault v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2002 FCA 125 at paragraph 13). The fact that the applicant's Canadian children might be better off in Canada in terms of general comfort and future opportunities cannot be conclusive in an H  &  C decision (see Vasquez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 FC 91 at paragraphs 41 to 43).\n \n[19]             The respondent submitted that the decision of Love\, relied on by the applicant\, was affected in part by the fact that if the applicant were removed from Canada\, his five children and their mother would have to go on welfare due to the Canadian citizen spouse's inability to support herself and her five children alone. The respondent submitted that that is not the case here. It was submitted that there is evidence to suggest that the Canadian citizen spouse\, who is the primary wage earner in the family\, has a close relationship with his daughters and will also have the benefit of the assistance of his mother and his grandfather who reside with the family.\n \n[20]             The respondent submitted that the immigration officer provided the appropriate level of analysis concerning the interests of the children in proportion to the evidence submitted by the applicant (see Owusu v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FCA 38). The applicant stated that her young daughters would be devastated and broken hearted if she had to leave Canada to apply for a permanent resident visa. She also stated that her children were attached to their father and that they would be very hurt emotionally if they were to be separated from their father. The respondent submitted that the immigration officer understood the difficulties that confronted the applicant and addressed the situation reasonably in her reasons for the decision. The respondent submitted that if there were more issues to be considered when assessing the interests of the children\, the applicant did not provide the immigration officer with sufficient evidence of that to warrant the officer engaging in a more in-depth analysis.\n \nRelevant Statutory Provisions\n \n[21]             An H  &  C application is permitted under section 25 of IRPA\, which provides:\n\n\n\n 25. (1) The Minister shall\, upon request of a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act\, and may\, on the Minister's own initiative\, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them\, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected\, or by public policy considerations.\n \n(2) The Minister may not grant permanent resident status to a foreign national referred to in subsection 9(1) if the foreign national does not meet the province's selection criteria applicable to that foreign national.\n\n  \n\n 25. (1) Le ministre doit\, sur demande d'un _tranger interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas _ la pr_sente loi\, et peut\, de sa propre initiative\, _tudier le cas de cet _tranger et peut lui octroyer le statut de r_sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des crit_res et obligations applicables\, s'il estime que des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire relatives _ l'_tranger - compte tenu de l'int_r_t sup_rieur de l'enfant directement touch_ - ou l'int_r_t public le justifient.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) Le statut ne peut toutefois _tre octroy_ _ l'_tranger vis_ au paragraphe 9(1) qui ne r_pond pas aux crit_res de s_lection de la province en cause qui lui sont applicables.\n\n\n\n\n \nAnalysis and Decision\n \n[22]             The appropriate standard of review for a decision of an immigration officer on an H  &  C application is reasonableness simpliciter (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at 857 to 858).\n \n[23]             Issue 1\n              Was the decision of the immigration officer unreasonable as it failed to be alive\, alert\, and attentive to the best interests of the applicant's children?\n              The immigration officer's decision with respect to the best interests of the two Canadian born children reads as follows:\nHaving considered her actions in period between her arrival to Canadain 1994 and her arrest in 2003\, she has demonstrated her lack of respect and regard to our immigration laws. She has not provided sufficient evidence that her actions were justified and were due to reasons beyond her control.\n \nDuring the time the applicant has been in Canada she married Hector Chamale who is a citizen of Canada. Her husband has not provided sufficient evidence of his willingness to sponsor. I note that the applicant does not have valid temporary resident status in Canada and is ineligible to be sponsored as a member of the family class. Therefore\, I have given the absence of the sponsorship little weight.\n \nThey now have two daughters\, Thelma and Damaris. Their daughters are aged five and three\, respectively. The applicant has a difficult choice ahead of her. She will either have to leave her children behind or take them with her. I will acknowledge that this will be a difficult decision for the applicant. I also acknowledge that the children may face difficult times in being away from either parent. I am not satisfied that their best interests will be jeopardized. They will have the love\, care and support of the custodial parent. That parent can ensure that the children will be well cared for and offer any support that is necessary to get through any difficulties the child may face.\n \nI cannot ignore the fact that the applicant built her new life during a time that she had no status in Canada. She remained in Canada long after the period authorized for her stay. She has created the situation in which she now finds herself. I further note that she has two other daughters remaining in Guatemala. Today\, they are 12 and 13. When the applicant left Guatemala\, they were two and three. They were no older than the Canadian born children are today; yet the applicant was able to leave them in Guatemala. I note that she has been separated from them for the past ten years. Undoubtedly the children in Guatemala are just as deserving of having the physical presence of their mother. I am not satisfied that she has demonstrated that the hardship faced by her Canadian born children would be any greater than the children who have been without their mother for the past ten years.\n \n \n[24]             There was evidence before the immigration officer that the applicant had been detained for three days by the immigration authorities. During this time\, the applicant's children refused to eat and were crying all the time. The applicant's husband\, who is the children's father\, was present. The immigration officer did not consider\, in her reasons for the decision\, the reaction of the children to their mother's three day immigration detention.\n \n[25]             There was also evidence that the oldest child was in kindergarten and had many friends there. The immigration officer was aware that the applicant was the primary caregiver who stated at home to care for the children while her husband worked and provided the financial support for the family. The immigration officer was also aware that the children's language is English.\n \n[26]             The immigration officer's assessment does not address how the best interests of the applicant's five and three year old children would not be jeopardized if their mother were to be removed to Guatemala\, other than that the children would have the love\, support and care of the custodial parent. If the father were to be the custodial parent\, the immigration officer did not consider who would care for the children when the father was at work.\n \n[27]             The immigration officer also did not address the situation of the two children should the applicant take them with her to Guatemala. For example\, they would be going to a country where the language was not English. The oldest child would be taken out of kindergarten.\n \n[28]             I agree with the respondent that the best interests of the children do not always trump other factors. However\, in this case\, the decision does not show that a balancing with other factors was carried out.\n[29]             In light of the above\, I am not persuaded that the immigration officer made an adequate assessment of the best interests of the children.\n \n[30]             Issue 2\n              Did the immigration officer err in failing to request and elicit additional information concerning the best interests of the applicant's children?\n              I am of the opinion that the immigration officer was under a duty to obtain further information concerning the best interests of the Canadian born children if the officer believed the information presented by the applicant to be insufficient to assess the best interests of the children.\n \n[31]             In Bassan v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2001 FCT 742\, Justice McKeown stated at paragraph 6:\nAn H and C officer must make further inquiries when a Canadian born child is involved in order to show that he or she has been attentive and sensitive to the importance of the rights of the child\, the child's best interests and the hardship that may be caused to the child by a negative decision. As stated by Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dub_\, such further inquiry\, ""is essential for an H and C decision to be made in a reasonable manner"".\n \n[32]             The present case is not the type of situation described by Justice Evans in Owusu\, supra\, at paragraph 9:\nThe half-sentence on page four of the seven-page letter\, quoted above in paragraph 6\, said only that Mr. Owusu would be unable to support his family financially if he was deported was too oblique\, cursory and obscure to impose a positive obligation on the officer to inquire further about the best interests of the children. The letter did not say that Mr. Owusu had been supporting his children from the money he earned while in Canada\, and that they were financially dependent upon him and would be deprived of that support if he was deported. Nor was there any proof before the officer of any of these facts.\n \n[33]             I am satisfied that the evidence before the immigration officer in this case was sufficient to require the officer to make any further inquiries necessary to adequately address the best interests of the Canadian born children.\n \n[34]             The application for judicial review is therefore allowed and the matter is remitted for redetermination by a different immigration officer.\n \n[35]             Neither party wished to submit a proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification.\n  JUDGMENT\n \n[36]             IT IS ORDERED that the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted for re-determination by a different immigration officer.\n \n \n \n""John A.

Overview\n[1]              \nMr. Khosa\nmarried his sponsor knowing he was without status in Canada subsequent\nto his release from immigration detention on a $3\,000 bond and conditions.\nTwelve days later\, Mr. Khosa met his spouse\, Lauren Jayne Patricia Baker\,\na Canadian citizen. On May 11\, 2008\, approximately one-and-one half months\nafter meeting\, Mr. Khosa and Ms. Baker married and began cohabiting.\nA party cannot expect to use circumstances of harm to secure a stay of\nremoval (Benedict v. Canada (Solicitor General)\, 2004 F.C.\n555\, at para. 22.\n[2]              \nMr. Khosa\nhas been in Canada since 2005.\nSince this time he has had the benefit of a number of immigration processes\,\nincluding consideration for permanent residence under the Live-in Caregiver\nClass and a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment. Although Mr. Khosa does not have\na criminal record in Canada\, he does not have clean hands.\nMr. Khosa disregarded Canadian immigration laws by partaking in\nunauthorized work.\n \n[3]              \nIt\nis well established in the jurisprudence that a tribunal is presumed to have\nconsidered all the evidence before it\, unless there is clear and convincing\nevidence to the contrary. Moreover\, the decision-maker is not obliged to refer\nto all the evidence in the reasons.\n \n[4]              \n__The\nOfficer reasonably\, in my view\, had concluded that the marriage was not\ngenuine. Much of the evidence and observations related to the genuineness of\nthe Applicant__s marriage is also relevant to whether the marriage was entered\ninto primarily for the purpose of acquiring permanent residence in Canada. The lack of\ngenuineness presents strong evidence that the marriage was entered into for the\npurpose of gaining status. Moreover\, the Officer had before her the evidence\nthat the Applicant was married only after he was reported to immigration\nofficials and that he has a seven-year history of not complying with\nimmigration regulations. These were relevant considerations that were weighed\nby the Officer.__ As stated by Madam Justice Snider in Sunil Dutt Sharma v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 1131.\n\n\nII. Introduction\n[5]              \nThe Applicant\, Mr. Tejinder\nSingh Khosa\, seeks an\ninterim order staying the execution of his removal pending leave for\njudicial review of an Immigration Officer__s decision denying his application\nfor permanent residence as a member of the Spouse or Common-law Partner in\nCanada Class application. Mr. Khosa has failed to establish all three\nelements necessary to obtain a stay of his removal order.\n \n[6]              \nMr. Khosa\nis scheduled to leave Canada on January 27\, 2010.\nSince Mr. Khosa__s arrival in Canada\, in September 2005\, he has\nunsuccessfully engaged Canada__s immigration system to\navert his removal to India.\n \nIII. Background\n[7]              \nOn\nSeptember 29\, 2005\, Mr. Khosa entered Canada at the Vancouver International Airport. He was issued a work\npermit to work as a live-in caregiver under the live-in caregiver program.\n \n[8]              \nOn\nDecember 10\, 2007\, Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) received Mr. Khosa__s\napplication for permanent residence under the Live-In Caregiver Class.\n \n[9]              \nOn\nMarch 6\, 2008\, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) arrested and detained\nMr. Khosa at Supreme Pizza where he was working illegally. In an interview\nwith a CBSA Officer\, Mr. Khosa stated that he has been working at Supreme\nPizza as a kitchen helper since April 2007\, making $8.00 an hour. Mr. Khosa\nalso stated that he knew he was not supposed to be working at the restaurant.\nMr. Khosa was detained pursuant to section 55 of the Immigration and\nRefugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 (IRPA).\n \n[10]          \nOn\nMarch 7\, 2008\, the CBSA Officer issued a report under section 44 of the IRPA\nstating that Mr. Khosa is a foreign national who is inadmissible on\nthe basis of failing to comply with conditions imposed under the IRPA and\nthe Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002-227 (Regulations).\nThe CBSA Officer noted that Mr. Khosa was working in an occupation for\nwhich he was not authorized\, for an employer for whom he was not authorized and\nin a location for which he was not authorized. He was referred for an\nadmissibility hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB).\n \n[11]          \nOn\nMarch 10 2008\, Mr. Khosa was released from immigration detention on a\n$3\,000 bond and conditions.\n \n[12]          \nOn\nMarch 22\, 2008\, Mr. Khosa met his sponsor\, Ms. Lauren Jayne Patricia\nBaker\, a Canadian citizen.\n \n[13]          \nOn\nMay 11\, 2008\, approximately one and a half months after meeting\, Mr. Khosa\nand Ms. Baker married and began cohabitating.\n \n[14]          \nOn\nJune 6\, 2008\, CIC received Mr. Khosa__s application for permanent residence\nunder the Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada Class.\n[15]          \nOn\nJuly 22\, 2008\, Mr. Khosa__s admissibility hearing was held before the IRB.\n \n[16]          \nOn\nJuly 31\, 2008\, the IRB decided on Mr. Khosa__s admissibility hearing. The IRB\nwas satisfied that Mr. Khosa was working at Supreme Pizza\, performing\nunauthorized work\, and was in contravention of his work permit. The IRB\nsubsequently held that Mr. Khosa failed to comply with section 29(2) of\nthe IRPA and is inadmissible pursuant to paragraph 41(a) of the\nIRPA.\n \n[17]          \nOn\nJuly 31\, 2008\, an Exclusion Order was issued against Mr. Khosa.\n \n[18]          \nOn\nor around October 1\, 2008\, Mr. Khosa submitted a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment\n(PRRA) application. Mr. Khosa alleged that he faced a risk of extrajudicial\nsanctions because he may be suspected of being a Sikh militant.\n \n[19]          \nOn\nNovember 4\, 2008\, Mr. Khosa__s application for permanent residence pursuant\nto the Live-In Caregiver Class was refused.\n \n[20]          \nOn\nJune 9\, 2009\, Mr. Khosa and Ms. Baker were interviewed together and\nseparately for the purpose of Mr. Khosa__s application for permanent\nresidence as a member of the Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada Class.\n \n[21]          \nOn\nNovember 3\, 2009\, an Immigration Officer refused Mr. Khosa__s application\non the basis that Mr. Khosa did not demonstrate that he is a spouse as\ndefined in section 4 of the Regulations\, and that the marriage was considered\nto be for the purpose of acquiring status under the IRPA.\n \n[22]          \nOn\nNovember 4\, 2009\, a PRRA Officer denied Mr. Khosa__s PRRA application on\nthe basis that there is no serious possibility that he would suffer persecution\npursuant to section 96 of the IRPA or would be subjected personally to a\nrisk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to section 97 of the\nIRPA. The PRRA Officer noted that Mr. Khosa was unlikely to be of\ninterest to the authorities in India\nif removed.\n \n[23]          \nMr. Khosa\nis scheduled for removal from Canada to Delhi\, India on January 27\, 2010 at 12:45 a.m. Mr. Khosa\nis to report to the Canadian Immigration Centre at Vancouver International Airport at 8:45 p.m. on January\n26\, 2010 to obtain his travel documents and to complete departure requirements.\nHe will be travelling on a valid Indian passport.\n \nIV. Issue\n[24]          \nThe\nissue before the Court on this stay motion is whether Mr. Khosa has\nsatisfied the three-part test for an order staying his removal from Canada by showing that:\na.      \nthere is a serious\nissue with respect to the Immigration Officer__s decision to be tried;\n \nb.     \nhe would suffer\nirreparable harm if the stay application is refused; and\,\n \nc.      \nthe balance of\nconvenience favours staying the removal order.\n \n(Toth v. Canada (Minister of Employment\nand Immigration) (1988)\,\n86 N.R. 302\, 11 A.C.W.S. (3d) 440 (F.C.A.)).\n \n[25]          \nThe\nCourt is in full agreement with the position of the Respondents.\n \nV. Analysis\nA. Relevant Legislative Provisions\n[26]          \nTo\nobtain a\npermanent resident visa as a member of the Spouse or Common-law Partner in\nCanada Class\, Mr. Khosa had to meet the requirements set out by the IRPA\nand the Regulations.\n \n[27]          \nSection\n12(1) of the IRPA provides:\n\n\n\n\n12.      (1) A foreign national may be\n  selected as a member of the family class on the basis of their relationship\n  as the spouse\, common-law partner\, child\, parent or other prescribed family\n  member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.\n \n\n\n12.      (1) La s_lection des\n  _trangers de la cat_gorie _ regroupement familial _ se fait en\n  fonction de la relation qu__ils ont avec un citoyen canadien ou un r_sident\n  permanent\, _ titre d___poux\, de conjoint de fait\, d__enfant ou de p_re ou m_re\n  ou _ titre d__autre membre de la famille pr_vu par r_glement.\n\n\n\n\n \n[28]          \nSection\n4 of the Regulations provides the definition of spouse:\n\n\n\n\n4. For the purposes of these\n  Regulations\, a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse\, a\n  common-law partner\, a conjugal partner or an adopted child of a person if the\n  marriage\, common-law partnership\, conjugal partnership or adoption is not\n  genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any\n  status or privilege under the Act.\n\n\n4. Pour\n  l__application du pr_sent r_glement\, l___tranger n__est pas consid_r_ comme\n  _tant l___poux\, le conjoint de fait\, le partenaire conjugal ou l__enfant\n  adoptif d__une personne si le mariage\, la relation des conjoints de fait ou\n  des partenaires conjugaux ou l__adoption n__est pas authentique et vise\n  principalement l__acquisition d__un statut ou d__un privil_ge aux termes de la\n  Loi.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n[29]          \nSection\n124 of the Regulations defines the membership parameters of the Spousal or\nCommon-law Partner Class:\n\n\n\n\n124. A\n  foreign national is a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class if they\n \n \n(a) are the spouse or\n  common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor in Canada;\n \n(b) have temporary\n  resident status in Canada; and\n \n \n(c) are the subject of a\n  sponsorship application.\n\n\n124. Fait\n  partie de la cat_gorie des _poux ou conjoints de fait au Canada l___tranger\n  qui remplit les conditions suivantes :\n \na) il est l___poux ou le conjoint de fait\n  d__un r_pondant et vit avec ce r_pondant au Canada;\n \nb) il d_tient le statut de r_sident\n  temporaire au Canada;\n \nc) une demande de parrainage a _t_\n  d_pos_e _ son _gard.\n\n\n\n\n \n[30]          \nIn\nthe present case\, Mr. Khosa did not satisfy the Immigration Officer that\nhe met both requirements in section 4 of the Regulations: (1) that the marriage\nwas genuine; and\, (2) that he had not entered the marriage for the purpose of\nremaining in Canada.\n\n\nB. Serious Issue\n[31]          \nThere\nis no merit to Mr. Khosa__s argument that the Immigration Officer did not\nprovide sufficient reasons for both branches of the test under section 4 of the\nRegulations. Reading the Immigration Officer__s reasons as a whole\ndemonstrates that the Officer questioned whether the marriage\nwas genuine or simply cosmetic for the purpose of immigration (da Silva v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC 1138\, 161 A.C.W.S. (3d) 974 at paras.\n11-12).\n \n[32]          \nA\nstrong link exists between the two prongs of the test. Specifically\, the Court\nhas found that the lack of genuineness presents strong evidence that a\nrelationship is entered into for the purpose of gaining status. It is Mr. Khosa\nwho bears the evidentiary burden on both prongs of the test (Sharma v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 1131\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1595 (QL) at\nparas. 16-18; Huang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 771\, 107 A.C.W.S.\n(3d) 117 at para. 7).\n \n[33]          \nIn\nthe present case\, the same evidence that the Immigration Officer reviewed to\nfind that the spousal relationship was not genuine was the same evidence that\nsatisfied her that the relationship was entered primarily to obtain Canadian\npermanent resident status. The Immigration Officer notably found Mr. Khosa\nlacking in credibility. It is also significant that she noted cause and effect\nas to the timing of Mr. Khosa__s arrest and the section 44 inadmissibility\nreport and the subsequent marriage shortly thereafter.\n \n[34]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer found on the basis of the following evidence that the\nmarriage is not genuine:\na)      Mr. Khosa stated\nthat he did not give his wife a ring when he proposed\, whereas his wife stated\nthat Mr. Khosa did;\nb)      Mr. Khosa said he\nand his wife both paid for the rings\, whereas his wife stated that Mr. Khosa\ndid;\nc)      Mr. Khosa stated\nthat his wife uses birth control pills\, whereas his wife stated that they only\nuse condoms;\nd)      Mr. Khosa and his\nwife provided discrepant answers on how often Mr. Khosa contacts his\nfamily;\ne)      Mr. Khosa and his\nwife provided inconsistent answers concerning their bedding and what each other\nwore to bed; and\,\nf)       \nMr. Khosa\nand his wife provided inconsistent answers about how many televisions they have\nin their home.\n \n[35]          \nThe incumbent\nlogic of the Immigration Officer__s substantiation of key inconsistencies and\nthe overall picture that arose during the interviews with Mr. Khosa and\nhis wife\, in addition to Mr. Khosa__s lack of credibility as demonstrated\, indicate\nthat both the genuineness of the marriage and purpose of the marriage were fully\nconsidered\, in further examples subsequently discussed below.\n \n[36]          \nIt\nis well established in the jurisprudence that a tribunal is presumed to have\nconsidered all the evidence before it\, unless there is clear and convincing\nevidence to the contrary. The decision-maker is not obliged to refer to all the\nevidence in its reasons (Florea v. Canada (Minister\nof Employment and Immigration)\, [1993]\nF.C.J. No. 598 (F.C.A.) (Q.L.))\n \n[37]          \nIn this\ncase\, the Immigration Officer explicitly noted that she reviewed all the\ninformation and submissions from Mr. Khosa. The Immigration Officer placed\ngreater weight on: Mr. Khosa__s lack of credibility\, the lack of joint\nassets; the timing and meeting of Mr. Khosa and his wife; the\ninconsistencies in Mr. Khosa and his wife__s answers during the interview;\nand\, Mr. Khosa__s misrepresentations of his address and work history. Mr. Khosa\nis essentially seeking for this Court to place greater weight on the evidence\nthat his wife is a 50% beneficiary on his life insurance policy and the\nphotographs he submitted. It is not the role of the Court to re-weigh evidence\n(Kengkarasa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2007\nFC 714\, 158 A.C.W.S. (3d) 973 at paras. 35\, 38; Singh v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 673\, 170 A.C.W.S. (3d) 147 at\npara. 10; Daniel v.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2007\nFC 392\, 156 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1144 at paras. 16-17).\n \n[38]          \nEqually\ndevoid of merit is Mr. Khosa__s assertion that the Immigration Officer\nerred in her credibility findings because she misconstrued the evidence.\nSpecifically\, Mr. Khosa states that the Immigration Officer misunderstood\nthe evidence with respect to his addresses in his application and his parents__\napproval of his marriage. To the contrary\, the Immigration Officer__s findings on\nthese inconsistencies are supported by the evidence.\n[39]          \nA\nreview of Mr. Khosa__s In-Canada Application for Permanent Resident Status (Application)\nshows the contradiction in his address listing. Under box 14 of Schedule 1 of the\nApplication\, Mr. Khosa states that he lived at 2488 McLeod Avenue from September 2005 to\nOctober 2007. Yet\, on the Client History Update Form\, which Mr. Khosa\ncompleted on July 14\, 2008\, he states that he lived at 2488 McLeod Avenue from October 2005 to\nJune 2008. The Immigration Officer therefore did not err in finding that Mr. Khosa\nhas not been consistent in providing his address information.\n \n[40]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer did not misconstrue the evidence concerning the families__\napproval of the marriage. In Mr. Khosa__s statement entitled __Development\nof our Relationship__\, attached to the Application\, he stated that he and his\nwife__s family members did not agree with the marriage and would not attend the\nmarriage. At the interview\, Mr. Khosa stated that his parents gave his\nwife jewellery and saris as wedding gifts. Based on this evidence\, it was not\nunreasonable for the Immigration Officer to find that Mr. Khosa__s\nstatements were contradictory.\n \n[41]          \nIn\naddition\, the Immigration Officer__s credibility findings were based\, in part\,\non Mr. Khosa__s failure to disclose his work at Supreme Pizza on the\nApplication. The Immigration Officer noted that the illegal work arrangement\nresulted in a section 44 inadmissibility report being issued\, prior to Mr. Khosa\nsubmitting the Application for Permanent Residence Status.\n \n[42]          \nFrom\nan interview\, the Immigration Officer concluded that Mr. Khosa was not\nforthcoming with requested information. This finding was based on her\nobservation that:\na)        \nMr. Khosa\nprovided vague and confusing answers concerning his immigration status in Canada and the reason for his\nexclusion order;\nb)        \nMr. Khosa\nstated that his wife knew everything about his immigration situation\, whereas\nhis wife stated that she knew little about Mr. Khosa__s immigration status\nand history.\n \n[43]          \nMr. Khosa__s\nallegation that the Immigration Officer should have questioned the couple__s\ninconsistencies with a request for their answers is not substantiated (Dasent\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996)\, 107 F.T.R. 80\,\n61 A.C.W.S. (3d) 570 at para. 5; leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused\, [1996]\nS.C.C.A. No. 141; Oppong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\n(1996)\, 193 N.R. 306\, 60 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1217 at para. 3; leave to appeal to\nS.C.C. refused\, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 140).\n \n[44]          \nCredibility\nfindings are entitled to deference. In this case\, the Immigration Officer__s\ncredibility finding is fully supported by the contradictions and inconsistencies\nin Mr. Khosa__s evidence (Kengkarasa\, above\, at paras. 1\,\n19).\n \n[45]          \nMr. Khosa\nhas failed to demonstrate a serious issue with respect to the Immigration\nOfficer__s decision.\n \nC. Irreparable Harm\n[46]          \nContrary\nto Mr. Khosa__s assertion\, irreparable harm does not necessarily result\nwhen there is a finding that there is a serious issue to be tried. If this\nCourt finds that there is a serious issue to be tried\, Mr. Khosa bears the\nonus of adducing clear and convincing evidence (not speculative and based on a\nseries of possibilities) that he will suffer irreparable harm if removed to India at this time. He has\nnot done so (Diallo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 84\,\n[2009] F.C.J. No. 126 (QL) at para. 27; Daniel\, above\, at para. 24).\n \n[47]          \nMr. Khosa\nasserts that he will suffer irreparable harm because he will be separated from\nhis wife. It is well established in the jurisprudence that separation from a\nspouse does not constitute irreparable harm. Such prejudice does not exceed the\nusual personal inconveniences of removal. Deportation inevitably causes some psychological and\nemotional hardship. As stated by the Federal Court of Appeal in Selliah v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FCA 261\, 132 A.C.W.S. (3d) 547:\n[13]      The\nremoval of persons who have remained in Canada without status will always disrupt the\nlives that they have succeeded in building here. This is likely to be\nparticularly true of young children who have no memory of the country that they\nleft. Nonetheless\, the kinds of hardship typically occasioned by removal\ncannot\, in my view\, constitute irreparable harm for the purpose of the Toth\nrule\, otherwise stays would have to be granted in most cases\, provided only\nthat there is a serious issue to be tried__ [Emphasis added].\n \n(Reference is also made to Daniel\, above.)\n \n[48]          \nMr. Khosa\nmarried his sponsor knowing that he was without status in Canada. A party cannot create\nthe circumstances of the harm which are then relied upon to secure a stay of\nremoval (Benedict v. Canada (Solicitor General)\, 2004 FC 555\, 130\nA.C.W.S. (3d) 822 at para. 12).\n\n\nD. Balance of Convenience\n[49]          \nA\nserious issue\, in and of itself\, demonstrating irreparable harm\, does not\nestablish a balance of convenience in the applicant__s favour. Each of the\ntri-partite tests must be established individually (Daniel\, above\, at\nparas. 29-31; Ahmed v. Canada (Solicitor General)\, 2004 FC 686\, 131\nA.C.W.S. (3d) 304 at para. 4).\n \n[50]          \nUnder\nthe IRPA\, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) is\nresponsible for maintaining and protecting the security of Canadian society and\nthe integrity of Canada's immigration and\nrefugee system. This entails the enforcement of removal orders as soon as is\nreasonably practicable which is to preserve the integrity of Canada__s immigration\nand refugee system (IRPA at. s. 3(2) and s. 48(2); Jama v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 374\, 166 A.C.W.S. (3d) 297\nat para. 7; Dugonitsch v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\,\n(1992)\, 53 F.T.R. 314\, 32 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1135 at para. 15).\n \n[51]          \nThe fact\nthat a person seeking a stay order has no criminal record\, is not a security\nconcern\, or is socially integrated in Canada\, does not constitute a balance of convenience that\nfavours granting a stay order. Successful integration into Canadian society is\nnot sufficient to overcome the public interest in the integrity of the administration\nof Canada__s immigration laws (Selliah\,\nabove\, at paras. 21-22).\n \n[52]          \nMr. Khosa\nhas been in Canada since September 2005. Since\nthis time he has had the benefit of a number of immigration processes including\nconsideration for permanent residence under the Live-In Caregiver Class\, and a\nPRRA. Although Mr. Khosa does not have a criminal record in Canada\, he does not have clean\nhands. Mr. Khosa disregarded Canadian immigration laws by partaking in\nunauthorized work (Ksiezopolski v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FC 1402\, 134 A.C.W.S. (3d) 682 at paras. 7-8).\n \n[53]          \nOnly\nin exceptional cases does an applicant__s interest outweigh the public interest.\nMr. Khosa has not demonstrated an exceptional case that would warrant\ndelaying the Minister of PSEP__s duty to ensure that the objectives of the IRPA\nare met (Dugonitsch\, above\, at para. 15; Selliah\, above\,\nat para. 22).\n \nVI. Conclusion\n[54]          \nMr. Khosa\nhas failed to establish all three elements necessary for this Court to grant an\norder staying execution of the removal order.\n \n[55]          \nFor\nall of the above reasons\, the Applicant__s application for a stay of execution\nof the removal order is denied.\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURT\nORDERS that the Applicant__s\napplication for a stay of execution of the removal order be denied.\n \n__Michel M.J.

He came to Canada in September 2001 as a student and claimed refugee\nprotection in October 2001. His application was rejected by the\nImmigration and Refugee Board in March 2005\, and in June 2005 the Federal Court\ndenied him leave for the judicial review of this decision.\n[3]              \nThe Applicant filed an application for permanent\nresidency based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in August 2005.\nIn April 2009\, this application was also denied\, and in\nSeptember 2010 the Federal Court once again denied him leave for judicial\nreview.\n[4]              \nThe Applicant was informed of his future removal\nin February 2012\, but he filed an application for a pre-removal risk\nassessment [PRRA] in March 2012\, which was denied in July 2012. This\ndecision remains unchallenged.\n[5]              \nIn May 2012\, while his PRRA application was\nstill pending\, the Applicant married Lucia Valvano\, a Canadian citizen and\nlawyer. In June 2012\, he filed an APR as a member of the spouse or\ncommon-law partner in Canada class\, sponsored by Lucia Valvano.\n[6]              \nAfter reviewing certain documents relating to\nthe Applicant on October 25\, 2013\, the Immigration Officer sent a letter\nto the Applicant and his sponsor summoning them to an interview and asking that\nthey provide additional documents. The interview took place on November 4\,\n2013\, and the next day\, on November 5\, 2013\, the Immigration Officer\nrequested further documents from the Applicant and his sponsor. Only some of\nthe requested documents were provided. \n[7]              \nOn November 21\, 2013\, the Applicant__s APR was\ndenied.\nIII.            \nDecision under review\n[8]              \nIn the letter and in her notes\, the\nImmigration Officer recalled the legislative framework\napplicable to the Applicant__s APR and found that she was not persuaded that the\nApplicant cohabits with his sponsor in Canada (pursuant to paragraph 125(a)\nof the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002-227\n[IRPR])\, and that the marriage was genuine and was\nnot entered into merely for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege\nunder the IRPA (pursuant to section 4 of the IRPR).\n[9]              \nIn coming to the conclusion\nthat the Applicant does not cohabit with his sponsor in Canada\, the Immigration Officer examined among other things the Applicant__s electronic file\nat the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA]\, where the Applicant is required to\nreport monthly. The Applicant claimed to live at 4555 Bonavista Avenue\, in Montreal\, Quebec\, with his spouse and sponsor. The Immigration Officer noted that the\nApplicant__s address in the file was 148 Waterbridge Drive\, in Ottawa\, since 2008\,\nthat he had yet to change his marital status\, still appearing as __not married__\,\nand that he still reported to the Ottawa office on a monthly basis despite\nliving in Montreal since May 4\, 2012. The Immigration Officer also\nexamined other documentary evidence which lead her to believe that the\nApplicant and his sponsor did not live together. The Immigration Officer also\nmade numerous findings with respect to the genuineness and the purpose of their\nmarriage.\nIV.            \nApplicant__s submissions\n[10]          \nThe Applicant claims that the Immigration\nOfficer__s decision is unreasonable because she relied on extrinsic evidence and\nfailed to confront the Applicant and his sponsor with respect to several of her\nmain concerns. The Applicant was not afforded with a reasonable opportunity to\nreply and this constitutes a violation of natural justice\, as he did not know\nthe case that had to be met. In addition\, in relation to other findings\, the\nApplicant contends that the Immigration Officer made a series of unreasonable\nplausibility inferences considering the evidence submitted.\nV.               \nRespondent__s submissions\n[11]          \nThe Respondent argues that both of the\nImmigration Officer__s findings are entirely reasonable and that either finding\n(i.e.\, the Applicant not living with his sponsor in Canada or their marriage\nnot being genuine) was sufficient to warrant her dismissal of the Applicant__s\nAPR.\n[12]          \nIt was reasonable for the Immigration Officer to\nconclude that the Applicant does not live with his sponsor in Canada as this finding was based on several elements obviously present in the Applicant__s file and\ninterview. Amongst other things\, the Applicant failed to change his address in\nhis electronic file at the CBSA and he continued to report in Ottawa despite\nallegedly living permanently in Montreal. Also\, the documentary evidence\nproduced demonstrates that the Applicant__s address in Montreal is nothing more\nthan a fa_ade.\n[13]          \nIt was also reasonable for the Immigration\nOfficer to find that the Applicant__s marriage with his sponsor was one of\nconvenience considering the evidence submitted and the factual findings on\nwhich her decision was based. The Respondent adds that the Immigration Officer\nhad the benefit of seeing the Applicant and his sponsor. Also\, contrary to the\nApplicant__s assertion\, the Immigration Officer did offer them an opportunity to\nreply by submitting them to an interview and by requesting that they produce\nadditional documents\, but she simply remained unsatisfied despite the\nApplicant__s response.\nVI.            \nApplicant__s reply\n[14]          \nIn replying to the Respondent__s claims\, the Applicant\nrefers to specific paragraphs of his original submissions but submits no\nadditional argument.\nVII.         \nIssues\n[15]          \nThe parties somewhat agree on the issues to be\naddressed by this Court\, and I would reword the questions as follows:\n1.    Did the Immigration Officer err when she dismissed the\nApplicant__s APR as a member of the spouse or common-law partner in Canada class?\n2.    Did the Immigration Officer breach procedural fairness by\nfailing to confront the Applicant and his sponsor to several of her main\nconcerns\, thus depriving the Applicant and his sponsor of the opportunity to\nrespond?\nVIII.       Standard of review\n[16]          \nThe first issue constitutes a factual\ndetermination to be examined under the standard of reasonableness (on the issue\nof cohabitation\, see Mills v Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 1339 at para\n19\, [2008] FCJ No 1745 and Said\nv Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2011\nFC 1245 at para 18\, [2011] FCJ No 1527 [Said]; for the genuineness of\nthe marriage\, see Kaur v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2010 FC 417 at para 14\, [2010] FCJ No 482 and Koffi v Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2014 FC 7 at para 16\, [2014] FCJ No 3 [Koffi]).\n[17]          \nAnd under the standard of reasonableness\, this\nCourt__s analysis will show great deference to the Immigration Officer__s\nfindings and will be concerned mostly with __the existence of justification\,\ntransparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process__. This\nCourt will have to determine __whether the decision falls within a range of\npossible\, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and\nlaw.__ (see Dunsmuir v New Brunswick\, 2008 SCC 9 at\npara 47\, [2008] SCJ No 9 [Dunsmuir]). Following this standard of review\, it is not up to the\nCourt to reweigh the evidence or __to substitute its own view of a preferable\noutcome.__ (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa\, 2009 SCC\n12 at para 59\, [2009] SCJ No 12 [Khosa])\n[18]          \nThe second issue\, as it is a question of\nprocedural fairness\, shall be reviewed following the standard of correctness (Khosa\,\nabove\, at para 43). With respect to this issue\, no deference is owed to the\nImmigration Officer (Dunsmuir\, above\, at 50).\nIX.            \nAnalysis\n[19]          \nPrior to embarking on the analysis of the two\nissues\, it would be appropriate to present an overview of the process\nundertaken by the Applicant and his sponsor under the IRPA and the Immigration\nand Refugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR]. The relevant legal\nprovisions are reproduced in the annexe to these reasons.\n[20]          \nThe Applicant applied for an APR as a member of\nthe spouse or common-law partner in Canada class. Sections 12 and 13 of the\nIRPA enact the right to be sponsored and to sponsor\, stating that\, subject to\nthe IRPR\, a Canadian citizen or permanent resident can __sponsor a foreign\nnational who is member of the family class.__ Section 123 of the IRPR prescribes\nthat __the spouse or common-law partner in Canada [__] is a class of persons who\nmay become permanent residents [__]__ pursuant to section 12 of the IRPA.\nSection 124 specifies who exactly qualifies as a __member__ of the __spouse\nor common-law partner in Canada class__\, including the fact that the member must\nbe the __spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor and cohabit with that sponsor\nin Canada__. As such\, in order to be considered a member of the appropriate\nclass\, the Applicant must live with his spouse\, but the Immigration Officer\nconcluded that he did not.\n[21]          \nWhat is more\, section 4 of the IRPR further\nspecifies that a person shall not be considered a spouse or a common law partner\nin cases where the marriage was __entered into primarily for the purpose of\nacquiring any status or privilege under the [IRPA]__ or that __is not genuine.__\nIn the present matter\, the Immigration Officer found that the marriage failed\non both accounts.\nA.   Did the Immigration Officer err when she\ndismissed the Applicant__s APR as a member of the spouse or common-law partner\nin Canada class?\n[22]          \nConsidering the decision under review and the\narguments submitted\, this issue requires that this Court determine whether the\nImmigration Officer__s findings are reasonable with respect to both the\ncohabitation of the spouses and the genuineness of their marriage. As stated\nabove\, this Court must avoid reweighing the evidence while doing so\, as this\nwas the task of the decision-maker. Here\, the Applicant mostly makes\nunsupported assertions which cannot override the reasonableness of the decision\nas a whole.\n[23]          \nFirst\, was it reasonable for the Immigration\nOfficer to conclude that the Applicant failed to establish\, on a balance of\nprobabilities\, that he cohabited with his sponsor in Canada? For the following\nreasons\, this Court finds this conclusion was reasonable.\n[24]          \nAlthough certain elements did tend to establish\nthat the Applicant and his sponsor lived together in Canada (certain monthly\nbills\, the lease for the Montreal apartment\, Quebec driver__s licence\, etc.)\,\nseveral pieces of evidence established otherwise\, i.e. that they lived apart.\n[25]          \nOne of the main reasons why the Immigration\nOfficer did not believe the Applicant cohabited with his sponsor in Canada is\nthe electronic file regarding him that is under the responsibility of the CBSA\,\nwhich states that the Applicant must report to the CBSA office in Ottawa on a\nregular basis and that he must inform the CBSA of any change in his residential\naddress in the 48 hours following the change. According to this file examined\nby the Immigration Officer\, the Applicant is not married and still resides at 148 Waterbridge Drive in Ottawa even though he claims to be living in Montreal with his\nsponsor. The Immigration Officer even contacted a CBSA office to confirm the\ninformation. To the contrary of what the Applicant contends\, he was confronted\nwith this concern during his interview by the Immigration Officer\, but he\nsimply failed to provide a satisfactory response. This is a strong piece of\nevidence against the Applicant__s claim because he failed to change his address\ndespite having the obligation to do so. It is hard to understand why the\nApplicant\, who allegedly lives in Montreal\, would prefer his file not be\ntransferred in that city.\n[26]          \nOn top of the CBSA electronic file on the\nApplicant stating that he is not married and that he lives in Ottawa\, there\nwere other elements in the application which lead the Immigration Officer to\nfind that the Applicant did not reside with his sponsor\, including the\nfollowing:\n-           The\nApplicant still reports on a monthly basis to the CBSA in Ottawa despite living\nin Montreal since May 4\, 2012;\n-           The\nApplicant__s credit card statements indicate that he travels frequently between Ottawa and   Montreal;\n-           The\nApplicant__s correspondence coming from his financial institution is all sent to\nhis address in Ottawa;\n-           The\nApplicant owns a $350\,000 house at 150 Waterbridge Drive\, in Ottawa\, which he\nrents out to three people\, and the leases signed after the Applicant__s alleged\nmove to Montreal all state that his address is in Ottawa;\n-           Despite\nowning a $350\,000 house in Ottawa\, the Applicant and his sponsor allegedly live\ntogether in a one-bedroom apartment in Montreal;\n-           The\nApplicant__s corporation income tax return for 2012 states that his address is\nin Ottawa;\n-           The\nApplicant did not produce an income tax return for 2012 in Quebec.\n[27]          \nThe Applicant and his sponsor were asked on two\noccasions to provide additional documents __ once at the interview and another\ntime by way of letter sent after the interview. The Applicant sent only limited\ndocuments\, and the documents thus submitted were explicitly considered by the\nImmigration Officer in her reasons. \n[28]          \nCombined\, all these elements certainly make it\nreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have found that the Applicant failed\nto establish\, on a balance of probabilities\, that he cohabits with his sponsor\nin Canada\, as she was simply not convinced. Her reasons and notes in this\nregard are clear and intelligible and they definitely allow this reviewing\ncourt to understand why she took this decision (Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses__ Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury\nBoard)\, 2011 SCC 62 at paras 14-16\, [2011] SCJ No 62).\n[29]          \nAs such\, I find that the Immigration Officer__s\nfinding that the Applicant had not satisfied the requirement set out in\nparagraph 124(a) of the IRPR was reasonable. This finding does not\nwarrant this Court__s intervention.\n[30]          \nAlthough\, as duly noted by the Respondent in its\nfactum\, a negative finding with respect to the cohabitation of the spouses\nunder paragraph 124(a) of the IRPR is sufficient to reject the\nclaim as a whole for absence of sponsorship (see Said\, above\, at paras\n34-35)\, I will nonetheless examine the issue of the marriage.\n[31]          \nSecond\, was it reasonable for the Immigration\nOfficer to conclude that the Applicant failed to establish\, on a balance of\nprobabilities\, that his marriage to his sponsor was genuine and was not entered\ninto primarily for him to acquire a status of a privilege? The Immigration\nOfficer__s conclusion in this regard is based on the following factual findings:\n-           There is\nan 11 year age difference between the spouses;\n-           Practically\nall family members and friends of the spouses do not know about the\nrelationship;\n-           Only\na few family members attended the wedding\, which took place in Ottawa;\n-           The\nApplicant claims that his sponsor__s family members did not attend the wedding\nbecause of a family conflict but he does not know the nature of this conflict;\n-           The\nspouses know little of each other__s interests and share few common life goals\nand plans;\n-           The\nspouses allegedly live together in a one-bedroom apartment despite the fact\nthat the Applicant owns a $350\,000 house in Ottawa;\n-           The\nApplicant__s professional activities take place exclusively in Ottawa while his\nsponsor works only in Montreal;\n-           The\nspouses are not financially interdependent;\n-           The\nsponsor knows little of the Applicant__s past;\n[32]          \nThe finding related to the age difference is\nweaker\, but the others are quite strong and fully explain the fact that the\nImmigration Officer was not convinced of the genuineness of the Applicant__s\nmarriage to his sponsor.\n[33]          \nThe Applicant and his sponsor contend that their\nexplanations were not considered by the Immigration Officer\, but the notes and\nreasons indicate the contrary. Once again\, the Applicant and the sponsor simply\nfailed to provide satisfactory answers and explanations\, and as noted by the\nRespondent\, assessing the genuineness of the marriage\, or lack thereof\, was\nsolely the duty of the Immigration Officer:\n[1]        It is well established in\nthe case law of this Court that there is no specific criterion\, or even a set\nof criteria\, to determine whether a marriage is genuine pursuant to section 4\nof the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]\n(Ouk v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC 891 at\npara 13; Zheng v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2011\nFC 432 at para 23; Khan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2006 FC 1490 at para 20). It is exclusively up to the visa officer to determine\nthe relative weight to grant each of the factors\, based on the facts\, to ensure\nthe inherent logic of the applicant__s story according to the particular clues\,\nor references made by the applicant himself\, meaning the encyclopedia of\nreferences\, a dictionary of terms\, a picture gallery of the applicant__s file in\naddition to an assessment to determine whether the facts on file taken together\ncreate harmony or discord (Keo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, 2011 FC 1456 at para 24; Zheng\, supra).\n[Koffi\, above\, at para 1]\n[34]          \nAs it was the case for the cohabitation of\nspouses\, the Immigration Officer__s reasons and notes are clear and intelligible\nand most certainly explain how she came to her conclusion\, which\, for this very\nreason\, shall remain undisturbed. Thus\, it was reasonable for the Immigration\nOfficer to find that the Applicant had failed to establish that his marriage\nwas genuine and not entered into for the purpose of acquiring any status or\nprivilege under the IRPA pursuant to paragraph 4(2) of the IRPR. Similarly\nto the first finding\, this second finding does not warrant the intervention of\nthis Court either.\nB.    Did the Immigration Officer breach procedural\nfairness by failing to confront the Applicant and his sponsor to several of her\nmain concerns\, thus depriving the Applicant and his sponsor of the opportunity\nto respond?\n[35]          \nThe Applicant claims that the Immigration\nOfficer should have confronted him with the content of the telephone\nconversation she had with the CBSA Officer in Montreal. The Applicant further\nargues that he should have been given the opportunity to disabuse the\nImmigration Officer__s concerns in this regard. \n[36]          \nHowever\, having read the notes\, I find that the\nApplicant was indeed offered the opportunity to address the Immigration\nOfficer__s issues regarding his file at the CBSA. To the question __According to your CBSA file you have a reporting requirement\nonce a month at CBSA office in Ottawa. So how do you manage this since you are\nliving in Montreal? Why you never ask your CBSA file be transferred to CBSA\nMontreal regarding your reporting requirement?__ (sic throughout) the\nApplicant answered: __Declares that he never asked to transfer his CBSA__s file\nto Montreal. Declares that he informed the CBSA Office of his change of address\nbut they ask him to continue to report there in Ottawa.__ (sic\nthroughout)  Even his sponsor spoke on the issue during the interview\,\nadding: __She knows that he has reporting requirement in Ottawa every beginning of the months. Declares that they never ask for his file to be\ntransferred in Montreal.__ (sic throughout)  \n[37]          \nAs such\, both the Applicant and his\nsponsor were made aware of the Immigration Officer__s concerns with\nrespect to the Applicant__s file at the CBSA and they were both given the\nopportunity to respond but simply failed to give satisfactory answers and\, consequently\, I find that the Immigration Officer\ndid not commit a breach of procedural fairness.\n[38]          \nThe parties were invited to\nsubmit a question for certification\, but none were proposed.\n\n\nORDER\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that this application\nfor judicial review is dismissed.

His refugee claim was denied on November 11\, 1995. On August 13\, 1997\, a post-claim determination officer found the applicant not to be a member of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada class.\n[2]      In December 1997\, the applicant sought permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.1 In her letter of decision\, the immigration officer determined that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate factors to warrant an exemption from normal legislative requirements.\n[3]      The applicant""s challenge of the immigration officer""s decision raises issues concerning the latter""s comments in her Humanitarian and Compassionate Narrative Report.2 This report was prepared on June 4\, 1998\, the date of the applicant""s interview with the immigration officer. The report is divided into six sections:\n\n \n          Section 1:      Background Information\n\n \n\n \n          Section 2:      Relatives in Canada\n\n \n\n \n          Section 3:      Relatives in Home Country\n\n \n\n \n          Section 4:      Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations\n\n \n\n \n          Section 5:      Degree of Establishment\n\n \n\n \n          Section 6:      Decision and Rationale\n\n \nThis form report has been completed in handwriting. The notes under section 4 deal principally with establishment issues concerning the applicant""s work history in Canada\, his sources of support\, his savings and his community involvement. The notes continue under section 5 (the words ""degree of establishment"" have been scratched out) and under section 6 with a summary of the applicant""s reasons for wishing to apply for permanent residence from within Canada. The last words under section 6\, immediately above the immigration officer""s signature\, are: ""Refusal: (see remarks on [computer] screen)"".\n[4]      Counsel for the applicant referred to the immigration officer""s remarks taken from the computer screen as her ""rationale""\, which he stated is the term used by departmental officials\, presumably in the context of section 6 (""Decision and Rationale"") of the report. In her rationale\, the immigration officer noted that:\n\n \n      ... applicant""s main reason for wishing to apply for permanent residence within Canada is that he claims he is afraid to return to Guatemala for political reasons; ... applicant""s reasons for fear of return to Guatemala are the same as those presented in his refugee claim and PDRCC review; applicant did not have any new information to present concerning his fear of return to Guatemala; ...\n\n \nThe immigration officer then concluded that there would be no undue or disproportionate hardship suffered by the applicant should he be required to submit an application for permanent residence from Guatemala as required by the legislation.\n[5]      The applicant""s first argument\, that the immigration officer erred in not assessing and considering his establishment in Canada in her decision and rationale\, fails upon a closer review of her report. The applicant""s distinction between the immigration officer""s handwritten notes and her remarks recorded on computer is one without substance. The information\, including the data with respect to the establishment issues\, is all part of the same report.\n[6]      Concerning the applicant""s establishment in Canada\, the immigration officer noted that he has resided continuously with his sister since his arrival in this country. She noted his work history since 1995\, including his gainful employment since March 1996\, as a full-time baker. The immigration officer referred to his modest savings and his limited community involvement.\n[7]      With respect to the applicant""s concern in returning to Guatemala\, the immigration officer noted that: ""... he is afraid to return to Guatemala for the same reasons he presented in his refugee claim"". This is followed with a summary of the difficulties encountered by the applicant as a union leader in Guatemala\, including his detention by security forces for three days.\n[8]      The immigration officer was not misdirected when she referred to the applicant""s fear of returning to Guatemala as his ""main reason"" for wishing to apply for permanent residence from within Canada. The applicant invoked the same reason in his application form and his affidavit material does not dispute the immigration officer""s emphasis on this point in her observations.\n[9]      In Sandhu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,3 my colleague Justice Cullen dealt with a similar situation in these terms:\n\n \n      The above passage indicates that the immigration officer was well aware of the applicant""s concerns relating to fear. Although she does not specifically refer to this fear in her recommendation\, it is evident that these concerns were before her. On the basis of the above passage\, I cannot conclude that the immigration officer failed to consider the applicant""s fear of returning to India. The immigration officer did not fail to consider relevant evidence in this regard.4\n\n \nThe same can be said about the notes of the immigration officer in this case. While her section 6 rationale focussed on the applicant""s fear of returning to Guatemala\, I am satisfied that her refusal of the humanitarian and compassionate application was made with due consideration to the factors concerning his establishment in Canada\, which are set out at some length in her notes. There is no statutory requirement for the immigration officer to provide reasons for her decision. In the same spirit\, nor was she obliged to refer to each of her considerations in her rationale.\n[10]      In his second argument\, the applicant urges that the immigration officer failed to make any independent risk assessment herself in relying totally on the decisions of the Convention Refugee Determination Division and the post-claim determination officer. This submission must fail\, in my view\, on the basis of the applicant""s affidavit when his response to the immigration officer who asked if he was afraid to return to Guatemala:\n\n \n      I confirmed that I was. I told the officer that I had political problems\, in particular because I was a union activist\, gave details of my problems\, and confirmed that these were the reason for my refugee claim in Canada. I said I was still afraid for the same reasons and that conditions in Guatemala were still dangerous and unsafe. [Emphasis added.]\n\n \n [11]      In Gautam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,5 my colleague Justice Evans considered an identical argument that the immigration officer""s discretion was fettered by failing to conduct an independent risk assessment\, where the applicant invoked the same reasons that had been raised in the refugee hearing and the PDRCC review. I agree fully with the conclusion of Evans J.: ""It was quite appropriate for the officer to rely on the rejection of the other claims in rejecting the subsection 114(2) claim\, in the absence of either additional evidence\, or a submission that on their return ... the applicants would be subject to unduly harsh sanctions\, ..."".6\n[12]      In this case\, the applicant suggested that the immigration officer had failed to consider documentary evidence that he provided to her during the interview\, in addition to the extensive material that had been filed with his application. After noting that she had carefully reviewed all the information she gathered during the interview\, the immigration officer concluded that the ""applicant did not have any new information to present concerning his fear of return to Guatemala"". This statement which can be read as meaning that the immigration officer concluded\, even after reviewing the supplementary country condition documentation\, that he had presented no ""new information"" concerning his fear of returning to Guatemala. Even if the visa officer did not review the new documentary evidence\, which the applicant has not established\, there appears to be little\, if any\, information disclosed in this material to suggest that the situation in Guatemala had worsened. The passages relied upon by the applicant""s counsel refer to post-1996 peace process human rights violations\, none of which is related to the difficulties alleged by the applicant as the grounds for his fear of returning to Guatemala.\n[13]      For these reasons\, this application for judicial review will be dismissed. Neither party suggested the certification of a serious question.\n        ""Allan Lutfy""\n      J.F.C.C.\nOttawa\, Ontario\nMay 14\, 1999\n __________________ 1      This application was made pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act \, 1985 R.S.C.\, c.

Phinn [immigration officer] refusing the request of Piao Chen [Applicant] to obtain an immigrant visa from within Canada based on humanitarian and compassionate [H  &  C] grounds. The Applicant requests that the decision be overturned and sent back to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [Minister] for a new determination by a different immigration officer.\n \nFACTS\n \n [2]                 The Applicant is a 76 year old citizen of China. In 1995\, he arrived in Canada with his late wife to visit their daughter. This is the Applicant's third or fourth H  &  C application (it is not clear from the facts nor the documentation)\, all of which were refused as well.\n \n [3]                 On May 5\, 1999\, the Applicant was interviewed by the immigration officer and was given over a year to submit further evidence before a review of the circumstances and a final decision be taken by her on August 31\, 2001.\n \n[4]      In 1959\, the Applicant and his wife put their daughter\, Ling Ling Huang\, in the care of her aunt and uncle when she was only a baby.\n \n\n\n[5]      In 1961\, the aunt and uncle moved from Tianjin to Hong Kong\, bringing along the Applicant's daughter. In order to move to Hong Kong with the little girl\, the aunt and uncle needed to show authorities a document indicating that she had been adopted. Therefore\, the Applicant and his wife signed an agreement attesting that their daughter had been given to her aunt.\n \n[6]      In 1975\, the aunt and uncle immigrated to Canada and brought Ms. Huang as their own daughter. \n \n[7]      Canadian immigration records show that Ms. Huang was landed in Canada as the dependant daughter of her aunt and uncle\, and not as an adopted daughter.\n \n[8]      For various reasons\, the Applicant and his wife never got their daughter back and it was not until 1993 that they were reunited again. Since their reunification\, the Applicant has been living with his daughter who is providing him with all the necessary care.\n \nTHE H  &  C DECISION\n \n\n\n[9]      The immigration officer found that the Applicant's daughter was not an eligible sponsor. Also\, she was unsatisfied that a parent and child relationship was ever nurtured between Ms. Huang and her natural parents. The immigration officer stated that the Applicant had not convinced her that he would experience disproportionate or undue hardship if he returned to China\, nor that he was sufficiently established in Canada.\n \nISSUES\n \n[10]    1.           Did the immigration officer apply the proper test for H  &  C applications?\n \n2.        Did the immigration officer commit an error of mixed fact and law in denying the Applicant's natural daughter to sponsor his application?\n \nANALYSIS\nStandard of review\n \n[11]     Pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, the Minister is authorised to exempt persons from any regulations made under subsection 114(1) or to otherwise facilitate their admission into Canada where he is satisfied that such exemption or facilitation should occur owing to the existence of H  &  C considerations. The process is one which is highly discretionary\, and as such\, the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the immigration officer that there are sufficient H  &  C grounds to warrant a favourable recommendation.\n\n\n[12]    The standard of review applicable to an immigration officer's decision made pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, and section 2.1 of the Immigration Regulations\, 1978\, is reasonableness simpliciter. Under this standard of review\, a decision should be set aside if it is unreasonable\, which means that it is not supported by reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. See Kim v. Canada (M.C.I.)\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 43 (F.C.T.D.) per Dawson J. at paragraphs 11 and 12\, and Baker v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at paragraphs 62 and 63.\n                                                                                                                                                                         \nDid the immigration officer apply the proper test for H  &  C applications?\n \n[13]     The Immigration Manual\, c. IP5 (May 1999) at section 6.1\, states that:\nApplicants bear the onus of satisfying the decision-maker that their personal circumstances area such that the hardship of having to obtain an immigrant visa from outside of Canada in the normal manner would be (I) unusual and undeserved or (ii) disproportionate.\n \n[14]     In reading the immigration officer's decision of August 31\, 2001\, it is clear that she applied the reasonableness simpliciter test to the facts. After determining that the Applicant still had a brother in China\, still owned an apartment and would be eligible to a pension\, the immigration officer concluded that he would not suffer unusual or disproportionate hardship.\n\n\n[15]     I concur with the respondent in that the legal test found in the Immigration Appeal Division case Chirwa v. Canada (1969) Imm. Appeal Cases\, Vol. 4\, p. 338\, and proposed by the Applicant for H  &  C applications is not ""the only judicial definition"" (see page 32 of the Applicant's application record). Rather\, it should be read in conjunction with the Immigration Manual.\n \n[16]     Therefore\, the immigration officer did not err on this issue.\n \nDid the immigration officer commit an error of mixed fact and law by denying the Applicant's natural daughter to sponsor his application?\n \n[17]     Before getting into the parties' submissions\, I would like to present the legislative framework of a family class sponsored landing application in Canada.\n \n[18]     At subsection 3(c) of the Immigration Act\, the immigration objective established is ""to facilitate the reunion in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad"". In the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, 2001\, at subsection 3(1)(d)\, the related objective is to see ""that families are reunited in Canada"".\n \n\n\n[19]     In the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\, 2001\, at section 2\, the word ""relative"" means ""a person who is related by blood or adoption"".\n \n[20]     Subsection 2(1) of the Immigration Act defines ""member of the family class""\, inter alia\, as ""the sponsor's father or mother"". The word ""father"" is furthermore defined as:\n(a)    with respect to any person who has not been adopted\, the male of whom that person is the issue\, and\n \n(b)    with respect to any person who has been adopted\, the male who has adopted that person.        \n \n[21]     Regarding this definition\, Waldman in Immigration Law and Practice (Markham: Butterworths Canada Inc.\, 1994) comments that: ""The effect of this definition is to preclude from sponsorship a person's natural father\, if the person is subsequently adopted"".\n \n[22]     In light of the previous considerations\, I will now address the Applicant's argument that the immigration officer made a patently unreasonable finding of fact by asserting that the parent-child relationship was never nurtured between the Applicant and his daughter. The respondent argues that the actual finding made by the immigration officer was that there was insufficient evidence of a parent-child relationship having ever been nurtured over the decades.\n\n\n[23]     I agree with the respondent's contention that the Applicant and his daughter had absolutely no connection until she was 39 years old. There is no evidence of a nurtured relationship up until the moment they reunited in 1993. However\, beyond that point\, there is extensive evidence of a nurtured parent-child relationship.\n \n[24]     The immigration records indicate that Ms. Huang was landed in Canada as the dependant child of her aunt and uncle. These documents can presumably be taken for the validity of the adoption. Regardless of this and of the reasons why the Applicant and his daughter did not contact each other for almost forty years\, the fact remains that he is the biological father of Ms. Huang and they now want to be together again. In the record\, there is a DNA paternity test result of 99.97% confirming that the Applicant is the biological father of Ms. Huang and ample evidence that she really wants to take care of her newly found father.\n \n\n\n[25]     I understand that the legislation provides a definition of the term ""father"" to impeach potential scams. However\, in the case at bar\, I believe that the presence of a bona fide desire to reunite with a biological relative and that the evolution of the relationship since that reunification are sources of compassion for which the immigration officer should have considered more seriously. In my opinion\, our society is now more open to various family situations and the fact that a person may have two fathers\, one adoptive and one biological\, is highly possible in present days.\n \n[26]     In the arena of an H  &  C application\, the immigration officer has high discretionary powers and unless a decision is unreasonable\, the Court should not intervene. In the case at bar\, in relation to the application of the law\, the immigration officer was clearly right. However\, with regards to the facts and material in the record\, I think that the decision was made in a perverse and capricious manner.\n \n[27]     In my opinion\, there is room for interpretation of the law with respect to the immigration objectives and the new definition of ""relative"" as to not preclude a person to sponsor a biological parent if he or she already has an adoptive parent. I am of the view that the present circumstantial facts call for leniency of the immigration rules' application in relation to the immigration objectives.\n \n\n\n[28]     The respondent admits that we are faced with a sympathetic situation but that an application cannot be granted on this basis. Nevertheless\, I think that there is enough evidence on file to show that there is a sufficient parent-child relationship to conclude that the immigration officer made a capricious finding of fact which fettered his discretion. For this reason and in light of my interpretation of the immigration objectives and rules\, the decision was unreasonable.\n \n                                       ORDER\n \nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT:\n-    The judicial review application is allowed;\n \n-    The immigration officer's decision dated August 31\, 2001 is set aside and the matter is remitted to a different immigration officer for adjudication in light of these reasons;\n \n-      No question for certification.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   ""Pierre Blais                      \n                       J.F.C.C.\n\n\n \n \nFEDERAL COURT OF CANADA\nNames of Counsel and Solicitors of Record\n \n DOCKET:                         IMM-4823-01\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                 Piao Chen v.

His claim was refused at the conclusion of the Convention Refugee Determination Division (""CRDD"") hearing on March 25\, 1999. Written reasons were issued on April 21\, 1999.\n [3]                 On January 7\, 2000\, the applicant filed an application for landing within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (""an H  &  C application""). He was subsequently contacted by immigration authorities and attended meetings respecting arrangements for his removal from Canada. Following these meetings\, the applicant was scheduled to be removed from Canada on September 5\, 2000. \n [4]                 The applicant failed to appear for that scheduled removal\, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On November 7\, 2000\, counsel for the applicant sent extensive submissions to immigration officials\, concerning the risk the applicant would face if he were removed from Canada.\n [5]                 On December 12\, 2000\, the applicant was arrested\, and held in detention until December 19\, when authorities tried to deport him\, by plane\, back to Nigeria. However\, he resisted immigration authorities to such a degree that the airline concerned would not allow him to board the plane.\n [6]                 On December 22\, 2000\, the applicant's counsel made further submissions against the return of his client to Nigeria.\n\n\n [7]                 On January 3\, 2001\, immigration officials again attempted to deport the applicant. Again\, he resisted so much that the airline refused to accept him as a passenger.\n [8]                 In response to the applicant's alleged fear of returning to Nigeria\, the removal office requested a risk assessment by a Post Claim Determination Officer (""PCDO""). By letter dated January 5\, 2001\, the PCDO informed the applicant's counsel that she was of the opinion that the applicant would be at risk if returned to Nigeria\, but the risk opinion itself was not then provided to the applicant. It specified\, in part\, as follows:\nI am aware that the applicant has been refused boarding twice on aircraft that would take him to Nigeria. The reason for the pilots' refusals of the applicant has to do with his personal opposition to his removal. He has indicated in a variety of ways that he is afraid to return to Nigeria. While it is my opinion that he may be misinformed about the present situation in Nigeria\, it appears from his behaviour that this fear is very real to him. This fear has led to his strongly opposing his removal\, to the point where he would have to be forced to board the plane. It is my opinion that if the applicant is forced to board a flight\, perhaps in restraints\, and escorted to Nigeria\, it will be apparent to the authorities that he is a person of interest. They may believe that he is dangerous or become aware that he is a failed refugee claimant. This will be sufficient to result in his detention....It is my opinion that the applicant would be at risk\, as I believe that the only way that he will be placed upon an airplane to Nigeria is by force and in restraints.       \n         [9]                 On February 27\, 2001\, counsel for the applicant sent a third package of submissions in support of the applicant's outstanding H  &  C application to the immigration officer\, regarding why the applicant would be at risk if he returned to Nigeria. The applicant was granted an interview on July 19\, 2001\, to further present his case.\n [10]            By letter dated September 20\, 2001\, the immigration officer refused the applicant's H  &  C application for landing within Canada.\n\n\n [11]            The applicant submits the following issues for consideration:\n1) Did the immigration officer improperly fetter her discretion?\n2) Was the immigration officer biased against the applicant?\n3) Did the immigration officer err by failing to disclose the PCDO's risk assessment opinion to the applicant?\n         [12]            I consider each of these issues in turn\, after commenting upon the standard of review applicable in this case.\nStandard of review\n [13]              The law is settled regarding the standard of review which should be applied in the judicial review of H  &  C decisions. In Tartchinska v.Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000)\, 185 F.T.R. 16\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 373\, Nadon J. (as he then was) commented\, at paras. 18-19:\nIt is clear that exemptions for humanitarian and compassionate reasons are discretionary and that an applicant is not entitled to a particular outcome. In order to successfully attack a negative decision\, an applicant must show that the decision-maker erred in law\, acted in bad faith\, or proceeded on an incorrect principle: Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship  &  Immigration) (1999)\, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.); Shah v. M.E.I. (1994)\, 29 Imm. L.R. (2d) 82 (F.C.A.); Ogunfowora v. M.C.I.\, 41 Imm. L.R. (2d) 75 (F.C.T.D.).\n \nThe Supreme Court in Baker\, supra\, made it clear that the standard of review in humanitarian and compassionate grounds applications is reasonableness. Accordingly\, if the impugned decision is based on reasons that can withstand somewhat probing examination\, this Court is not empowered to alter that decision.\n [14]            In reviewing the immigration officer's decision to refuse the applicant's H  &  C application\, I apply the standard of reasonableness. \n\n\nIssues\nDid the immigration officer improperly fetter her discretion?\n [15]            The applicant submits that the immigration officer improperly fettered her discretion. In her reasons for decision\, the immigration officer commented:\nI have analyzed the elements of the CRDD member's reasons for decision\, as well as the elements of the risk opinion of the PCDO\, combined with the contents of the entire case. I conclude that the positive risk opinion does not outweigh the negative factors of this case.\n         [16]            The applicant submits that the passage quoted above indicates that the immigration officer\, when deciding the H  &  C application on the merits\, improperly relied upon the analysis and reasoning of previous decisions\, by the CRDD and the PCDO\, rather than independently considering the evidence\, as she was required to do.\n [17]            I am not persuaded by the applicant's argument on this point. In her reasons\, which comprise 12 single-spaced pages\, the immigration officer considered all the evidence before her prior to arriving at her decision. The mere fact that the immigration officer made reference to elements of the decisions of the CRDD and the PCDO does not indicate that the officer did not independently consider the evidence before her in this case.\nWas the immigration officer biased against the applicant?\n\n\n [18]            The applicant submits that the immigration officer was biased against him. He urges that bias is evident in the immigration officer's reasons\, which\, he claims\, attach unmerited significance to facts adverse to the applicant's claim\, and cursorily review evidence favourable to him.\n [19]            The applicant's submission on this point is\, in essence\, an argument that the immigration officer improperly weighed the evidence before her. However\, it is not the function of this Court on judicial review to assess the weighing of evidence by an immigration officer. Rather\, in reviewing an H  &  C decision\, this Court will only intervene if it can be shown that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable because she erred in law\, acted in bad faith\, or proceeded on an incorrect principle (see Tartchinska\, supra). I am not persuaded that the officer's decision was unreasonable in this case.\nDid the immigration officer err by failing to disclose the PCDO's risk assessment to the applicant?\n [20]            In her reasons for decision\, the immigration officer referred to the PCDO's risk assessment\, and then declined to follow its result. The applicant submits that the immigration officer breached the duty to act fairly by failing to disclose the PCDO's risk assessment\, or that it would not be accepted\, thereby denying him an opportunity to know and to comment on that document or a predisposition to ignore its result. In support of this submission\, the applicant relies on Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, where Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dub_\, writing for the majority\, commented\, at para. 32:\n\n\nBalancing these factors\, I disagree with the holding of the Federal Court of Appeal in Shah\, supra\, at p. 239\, that the duty of fairness owed in these circumstances is simply ""minimal"". Rather\, the circumstances require a full and fair consideration of the issues\, and the claimant and others whose important interests are affected by the decision in a fundamental way must have a meaningful opportunity to present the various types of evidence relevant to their case and have it fully and fairly considered.\n [21]            The applicant submits that by failing to disclose the PCDO risk opinion\, or that it would not be followed\, the immigration officer breached his right to a ""meaningful opportunity"" to present evidence relevant to his case\, and to have that evidence ""fully and fairly considered"".\n [22]            While the applicant in this case was not provided with a copy of the risk opinion\, he had been informed of its existence and its result. On January 5\, 2001\, the PCDO wrote the applicant's counsel to inform him of her opinion that the applicant would be at risk if he were to be removed to Nigeria. That letter further provided\, in part:\nThe Risk Opinion will be sent to the Enforcement office and to CIC Vancouver for consideration by the officer making a decision on your client's application for permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Please direct any questions regarding continued detention\, status of removal\, or final consideration of the H  &  C application to the most appropriate of the two offices.\n [23]            After the applicant learned of the existence of the PCDO risk assessment\, he had further opportunities to comment in regard to that assessment. On January 29\, 2001\, an immigration officer wrote the applicant\, inviting him to make further submissions\, which he did on February 27\, 2001. Some months later\, on July 19\, 2001\, the applicant attended a personal interview with the immigration officer\, where he was given a further opportunity to argue his case. In the circumstances\, I find that the immigration officer did not err by failing to provide the applicant with a copy of the PCDO's risk opinion. In my view\, the applicant had ample opportunity to present evidence relevant to his case\, and to have that evidence fully and fairly considered. \n\n\n [24]            The applicant further relies on Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999)\, 174 F.T.R. 123 (F.C.T.D.)\, where Mr. Justice Gibson quashed the H  &  C decision there under review. However\, the facts in this case are distinguishable from the facts in Haghighi. In Haghighi\, the applicant filed an H  &  C application\, which was referred by the immigration officer to the PCDO. In reaching a negative risk assessment\, the PCDO relied on a 1997 U.S. Department of State report (""the 1997 DOSS Report"") which was not among the materials submitted by the applicant in support of his H  &  C application. The immigration officer then relied on the negative risk opinion in deciding to refuse the applicant's H  &  C application. At para. 11\, Mr. Justice Gibson commented:\n...(N)either the PCDO recommendation and the analysis on which it was based nor the 1997 DOSS Report and the fact that it was relied on were disclosed to the applicant. In the result\, he was given no opportunity to respond to either.\n [25]            In this case\, unlike Haghighi\, the applicant was informed of the existence and the result of the PCDO opinion\, and was invited to direct any questions regarding continued detention\, status of removal\, or final consideration of the H  &  C application to immigration authorities. Furthermore\, in this case\, unlike Haghighi\, there is no allegation that the PCDO officer relied on any material which was not known by the applicant in considering the H  &  C application. The claim to unfairness in this case rests upon the inclusion of the risk opinion in materials considered in regard to the applicant's H  &  C application. The applicant was aware of the existence of that opinion\, and of its outcome\, and that it would be considered in the assessment of his H  &  C application. In the circumstances there was not unfairness in the process of the H  &  C decision.\n\n\nConclusion\n [26]            The application for judicial review will be dismissed. \n [27]            Immediately following the hearing I indicated to counsel that upon filing of these Reasons I would provide opportunity for them to consider and propose any serious question of general importance for certification under s-s. 83(1) of the Immigration Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. I-2 as then amended. I invite counsel to consult and to advise the Court\, through the Registry in Vancouver\, on or before September 12\, 2002\, of any question they may agree upon\, or failing agreement\, any question either party may propose.\n                                                                                                                                                                                      (signed) W.

I-2 of the decision dated January 29\, 2001 by the immigration officer. The immigration officer's decision denied the applicant's request to be approved on humanitarian and compassionate (""H  &  C"") grounds for an exemption from the requirement to apply for\, and obtain\, an immigrant visa prior to coming to Canada as required by subsection 9(1) of the Immigration Act\, supra.\n\n [2]                 The applicant seeks an order to quash the decision of the immigration officer and send the matter back for redetermination.\n\n\nBackground Facts\n\n [3]                 The applicant is a citizen of Jamaica. The applicant's arrival in Canada and ensuing immigration history is chronicled in the time-line below. Paragraphs in brackets indicate information that was not before the immigration officer at the time of the decision.\n\n  _          April 25\, 1997: The applicant arrives in Canada without an immigration visa or visitor's visa as required by the Immigration Act\, supra.\n\n  _          January 18\, 1999: A joint bank account belonging to the applicant and his sponsor is opened\, according to a letter from The Bank of Nova Scotia dated August 3\, 2000. The account had a balance of $154.12 at the time of the letter.\n\n  _          April 23\, 1999: The applicant meets his sponsor\, according to the applicant's recent application for H  &  C consideration (submitted December 15\, 1999).\n\n  _          May 10\, 1999: The applicant attends an interview with a previous immigration officer in connection with a previous application for spousal H  &  C consideration. The applicant is accompanied in the interview by his then wife and sponsor.\n\n  _          June 19\, 1999: The applicant proposes to his current sponsor.\n\n  _          July 21\, 1999: The applicant's previous application for H  &  C consideration is refused.\n\n  _          September 29\, 1999: The applicant divorces the wife who acted as his sponsor for the previous H  &  C application.\n\n  _          November 27\, 1999: The applicant marries his current sponsor.\n\n  _          December 15\, 1999: The applicant submits the recent H  &  C application.\n\n  _          May 25\, 2000: A deportation order is issued against the applicant\, noting that he was found working without authorization as described under paragraph 27(2)(b) of the Immigration Act\, supra.\n\n  _          May 25\, 2000: The applicant files a refugee claim.\n\n\n\n  _          July 28\, 2000: A letter with this date is sent from the immigration officer to the applicant requesting further information\, including evidence of a genuine marriage to his sponsor\, and of co-habitation and dating that had taken place since November 1999.\n\n  _          August 4\, 2000: The immigration officer is informed that the applicant's spouse has become pregnant\, by letter on this date sent from the applicant's Immigration Representative. A doctor's note indicating that the sponsor is pregnant and that the expected date of delivery is 21 January 1900 [sic] is attached.\n\n  _          August 30\, 2000: The immigration officer decided on this date not to grant an exemption for the applicant's recent H  &  C application\, according to the letter dated January 29\, 2001\, the immigration officer's notes and the immigration officer's affidavit.\n\n  _          (January 11\, 2001: The applicant's current sponsor gives birth to a Canadian-born child and the applicant is the child's father\, according to the applicant's affidavit of March 5\, 2001.)\n\n  _          (January 29\, 2001: A letter with this date is sent from the immigration officer to the applicant in which the decision to deny the applicant's request under H  &  C grounds is refused.)\n\n  _          (March 5\, 2001: The applicant swears an affidavit which states\, in part\, that the applicant knew his current sponsor since childhood\, and that he met her again in the summer of 1998.)\n\n [4]                 As noted above\, by letter dated January 29\, 2001\, the immigration officer informed the applicant of the decision to deny the H  &  C request for an exemption from the requirement of subsection 9(1).\n\nApplicant's Submissions\n\n [5]                 The applicant submits that the immigration officer breached the principles of procedural fairness in making a determination on the basis of a credibility finding without conducting an interview of the applicant.\n\n\n\n [6]                 The applicant cites the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, as support for the proposition that a high duty of procedural fairness applies in this case. The applicant refers to a quote by L'Heureux Dub_ J. where she stated:\nThe more important the decision is to the lives of those affected and the greater its impact on that person or those persons\, the more stringent the procedural protections that will be mandated.\n\n\n\n [7]                 The applicant submits that courts have recognized that credibility cannot be determined by way of written submissions. As a result\, the applicant submits that an affected person whose credibility is impugned must be given the opportunity to present via voce evidence to the decision-maker\, and respond to concerns. The applicant refers to the decision of Wilson J. in Singh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177 and the case of Baker\, supra for this proposition.\n\n [8]                 The applicant submits that the applicant has a right to enter into marriage and to form and enjoy the sanctity of a family under internationally recognized human rights.\n\n [9]                 The applicant submits that a credibility finding that a marriage is not bona fides has a direct and fundamental impact on the child of the relationship as it results in the dissolution of the family unit and indefinite separation of the father from his child. The applicant contends that such a finding may ultimately be permissible but not without a fair and appropriate process.\n\n\n\n [10]            The applicant submits that the immigration officer's decision that the applicant's relationship with his spouse was not bona fides was unreasonable and perverse. The applicant contends that it is unreasonable to base a refusal decision on a prior application for landing with a different spouse.\n\nRespondent's Submissions\n\n [11]            The respondent submits that the immigration officer complied with the duty of fairness and properly exercised her discretion in concluding that the applicant did not merit a waiver of the landing requirement pursuant to section 9(1) of the Immigration Act\, supra.\n\n [12]            The respondent submits that H  &  C review is a special and additional consideration for an exemption from Canadian immigration laws which are otherwise universally applied. As such\, the decision of an immigration officer not to recommend an exemption under section 114(2) does not take away any right from the applicant.\n\n [13]            The respondent submits that the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker\, supra makes it clear that an oral hearing is not necessary in order to consider an application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n\n\n\n [14]            The respondent contends that the ""child"" referred to by the applicant was only a fetus at the time that the immigration officer reviewed the individual circumstances of the applicant's application and decided that an exemption would not be granted. The applicant contends that the immigration officer reviewed the application on August 30\, 2000 and the child was due to be born in January\, 2001. The respondent submits that Baker\, supra does not impose a requirement to be alive and attentive to the interests of unborn children.\n\n [15]            The respondent submits that the immigration officer discharged all duties incumbent on her in making the assessment.\n\nLaw\n\n [16]            Subsection 9(1) of the Immigration Act\, supra states:\n\n \n \n9. (1) Except in such cases as are prescribed\, and subject to subsection (1.1)\, every immigrant and visitor shall make an application for and obtain a visa before that person appears at a port of entry.\n\n \n9. (1) Sous r_serve du paragraphe (1.1)\, sauf cas pr_vus par r_glement\, les immigrants et visiteurs doivent demander et obtenir un visa avant de se pr_senter _ un point d'entr_e.\n\n\n \n\n\n [17]            Subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, supra states:\n\n \n \n114.(2) The Governor in Council may\, by regulation\, authorize the Minister to exempt any person from any regulation made under subsection (1) or otherwise facilitate the admission of any person where the Minister is satisfied that the person should be exempted from that regulation or that the person's admission should be facilitated owing to the existence of compassionate or humanitarian considerations.\n\n \n114.(2) Le gouverneur en conseil peut\, par r_glement\, autoriser le ministre _ accorder\, pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire\, une dispense d'application d'un r_glement pris aux termes du paragraphe (1) ou _ faciliter l'admission de toute autre mani_re.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n [18]            Issues\n1.          What is the standard of review to be applied to this application?\n2.          Whether the immigration officer rendered a decision that was unreasonable.\n3.          Whether the immigration officer breached the principles of procedural fairness in making a determination on the basis of a credibility finding without conducting an interview of the applicant.\n\nAnalysis and Decision\n\n [19]            Issue 1\nWhat is the standard of review to be applied to this application?\nIn Baker\, supra\, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the standard of review for a H  &  C decision at page 821 as follows:\nIn applying the applicable factors to determining the standard of review\, considerable deference should be accorded to immigration officers exercising the powers conferred by the legislation\, given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry\, its role within the statutory scheme as an exception\, and the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language. Yet the absence of a privative clause\, the explicit contemplation of judicial review by the Federal Court -- Trial Division\, and the individual rather than polycentric nature of the decision also suggest that the standard should not be as deferential as ""patent unreasonableness"". The appropriate standard of review is\, therefore\, reasonableness simpliciter.\n\n\nDiscretionary decisions of the immigration officer on humanitarian and compassionate grounds involve issues of mixed fact and law and are to be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness\n\n\nsimpliciter. The standard of review for decisions of an immigration officer on questions of pure law is correctness.\n\n [20]            Issue 2\nWhether the immigration officer rendered a decision that was unreasonable.\nIt is quite clear from the record and other filed material that the applicant's first H  &  C application was based on a marriage of convenience or a marriage that was not bona fides. That marriage was entered into to facilitate the applicant's application to apply for landing from within Canada. That is not the end of the matter\, however\, since this judicial review deals with a second H  &  C application which is based on his second and current wife's sponsorship of him as a member of the family class.\n\n [21]            The second application must be dealt with on its own merits. As I read the reasons of the immigration officer\, considerable weight is placed on the fact that the applicant had made a prior H  &  C application with a different spouse sponsoring him. This factor can be considered but it should only be considered along with other factors which show the second marriage not to be bona fides or genuine. I have reviewed the last paragraph on page one of the immigration officer's ""Decision and Rationale"" and when I compare the request with the reply of the applicant's counsel dated August 4\, 2000\, it would appear that many pieces of the information sought were supplied. If there were concerns about any of the information\, a follow-up could have been carried out. I cannot find any evidence other than the fact that the previous marriage was not genuine and the fact that the applicant applied for H  &  C consideration within one month\n\n\nof his marriage to his second sponsor to support the finding that his second marriage is not genuine. For this reason\, I find that the decision of the immigration officer is unreasonable and must be set aside. I should note that I make no comment on whether the second marriage is bona\nfides as that is a question for an immigration officer. The matter is submitted to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n\n [22]            Because of my disposition of the second issue\, it is not necessary for me to deal with Issue 3.\n\n [23]            The parties will have one week from the date of these Reasons to submit any proposed serious question of general importance for my consideration and three days to make any response to a submitted question\, before I render my Order.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     ""John A.

In the nature of certiorari to set aside the decision of the immigration officer dated September 4\, 2003 and communicated to the applicants on September 9\, 2003\, wherein the said officer denied the applicants' application for an exemption from certain legislative requirements to allow their application for permanent residence to be processed from within Canada\, pursuant to H  &  C grounds;\n2.          In the nature of mandamus referring the matter to a different immigration officer; and\n3.          In the nature of prohibition staying the applicants' removal until such time as the applicants' application is re-assessed.\n \nBackground\n \n[3]                 The applicants are citizens of Korea. The principal applicant\, Moon Kap Kim (""the applicant"") arrived in Canada on October 23\, 1999. His wife\, Bok In Grace Kim\, and their two children\, Soo Jung Sue Kim and Soo Nam Paul Kim (""his wife and children"") arrived in Canada in December 1999. The family filed for refugee status but this was denied. On April 26\, 2002\, the applicants submitted an application for landing based on H  &  C grounds under subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. I-2.    Due to the coming into force of IRPA\, the application was ultimately dealt with pursuant to subsection 25(1) of IRPA. The application was refused on September 4\, 2003.\n \n[4]                 The applicant stated that he sold his business in the 1990s due to the economic crisis in Korea. He then supported his family at a subsistence level as a tennis instructor. He was unable to find other employment in Korea prior to leaving for Canada due to a societal expectation that those over 50 are no longer considered employable as they must retire by 55 and make way for younger workers. The applicant states he has no home\, no prospects for employment and no close family relations in Korea. The applicant and his wife have been employed since coming to Canada and both do charitable volunteer work. His wife is a pastor for a church in Toronto.  The children have adapted well to school in Canada and are also actively involved with their church and volunteer work.\n \nImmigration Officer's Entered Notes\n \n[5]                 The immigration officer's entered notes read:\nBased on all the information presented and the information outlined above\, I am not satisfied the clients would experience a hardship if they applied for landing in the normal manner.\n \n \nClient states they have severed all ties with Korea and established themselves in Canada culturally and economically.\n \n \nThey would be unable to leave without experiencing a hardship. I acknowledge clients have taken some steps to establish themselves\, but I am not satisfied that the level is such that a hardship would occur if they return. Insufficient evidence has been provided to state they are an integral part of their church congregation\, to cause a hardship [sic] and that they could not continue their volunteer services for a church in Korea. Insufficient evidence has been provided to state the wife could not develop her career as a pastor in Korea. She has taken theology in Korea and has experience leading bible studies in Toronto.  Insufficient evidence has been provided to state they have fully integrated into Canadian society\, socially\, financially and economically and developed roots to cause a hardship if they return. Clients have provided insufficient evidence to state they could not adjust to the life they left behind.  They made a decision to leave Korea on their own accord and sell their assets\, thus they created their personal situation in Korea.\n\n  \n \nClient states he would experience social persecution\, because he would be subjected to social and cultural sanctions due to his age. He is considered no longer employable and his family would have a bleak existence. I acknowledge the social structure is different in Korea and every person in this age group faces extra difficulties economically\, but this is not a personalized risk and I am not satisfied it is a disproportionate hardship when one's living standards have to be altered\, when you experience a recession. Client and family are resourceful and insufficient evidence has been provided to state they could not adjust to a different comfort of living in Korea.\n \n \nClient states his children would have difficulty readjusting to Korean school standards and experience hardship from loss of a social network (stimulus). I acknowledge the children have taken advantage of the opportunities available to them to discover world experiences\, but insufficient evidence has been provided to state similar experiences are not available in Korea. The children came to Canada during their formative years and are still in their formative years. Insufficient evidence has been provided to state they could not adjust to the school system they left behind. The older child has one year left in college and could finish school on her own and apply her skills in Korea.\n \n \nIt is noted many letters of recommendation were given from members of the congregation regarding the family's participation in the choir and leaders of study groups.  Even though they are valued members of the congregation\, insufficient evidence has been provided to state they are a significant benefit\, that a great loss to the church would occur and that the church could not function without their assistance. Based on the above factors\, I am not satisfied that sufficient evidence has been presented to state the hardship the clients would face would be undeserved and unusual or disproportionate\, if they applied for landing in the normal manner.\n \n \n \nIssues\n \n[6]                 The issues as framed by the applicants are:\n 1.          Did the immigration officer err in ignoring relevant evidence\, relying upon irrelevant considerations and in misapprehending the evidence before her?\n 2.          Did the immigration officer err in fettering her discretion in deciding that the applicants were not sufficiently established in Canada?\n 3.          Did the immigration officer err in not considering the best interests of the children?\n\n  \n 4.          Was the decision reasonable or did the immigration officer err in law and/or fetter her discretion in concluding that there was not sufficient unusual\, undue or disproportionate hardship?\n \nApplicant's Submissions\n \n[7]                  Relying on Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999)\, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.)\, the applicants stated that the standard of review of the H  &  C decision is reasonableness simpliciter.\n \nSufficiency of the Applicants'Establishment in Canada\n \n[8]                 The applicants submitted that they provided a significant amount of evidence to show they had established themselves in Canada. The evidence included bank statements\, tax filings\, certificates of achievements while in Canada and 60 letters of support from others\, especially members of their church.\n \n[9]                 The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred in requiring that the church be unable to function if the applicants left\, before the applicants' role in the church could be found to be evidence of establishment in Canada. The standard imposed by the immigration officer is one that could not realistically be met.\n\n  \n \n[10]             The applicant submitted that his wife had sufficiently established herself within the church to the extent that she was serving as an assistant pastor with an offer of full-time employment contingent on her obtaining permanent residence.\n \n[11]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer failed to consider the psychological and emotional ties of the family to the church. The immigration officer similarly failed to consider the congregation's and community's dependence on the wife's role as assistant pastor and the family's charitable and community involvement with the elderly\, the disabled and Native Canadians.\n \n[12]             The applicants submitted that this Court has held in Raudales v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2003 F.C.T. 385 and Jamrich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2003 F.C.T.804\, that a failure to giver proper consideration to the establishment of the applicants is a reviewable error.\n \n \n \n \nBest Interests of the Children\n \n[13]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred in not properly taking into account the best interests of the children. The immigration officer was required to be alert\, alive and sensitive to the rights of the children.\n \n[14]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred in law by not being sensitive to the effect that the age discrimination against the applicant would have on the children if they were to return to Korea and their father could not support them. The immigration officer was required to have defined the children's needs and considered them in relation to the parents' ability to provide for them upon their return to Korea.\n \n[15]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred by failing to take into account the number of years the children have been in Canada and their bonds with other family members and the church community. The children are still very young and will not be able to simply reintegrate into Korean society and attend school as the immigration officer concluded. If the family is required to return to Korea\, the applicant will not be able to fund their schooling and provide them with the opportunity to establish themselves or even care for them generally.\n \n \n \nUnusual\, Undue or Disproportionate Hardship:\n \n[16]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred in law and misconstrued the facts. Contrary to the immigration officer's finding\, the applicant's evidence was not that he would experience hardship as a result of a recession\, but as a result of not being able to support his family due to being prevented from finding employment because of his age and discrimination against people in his age group.\n \n[17]             The applicants submitted that the immigration officer erred in law in requiring that in order to experience a disproportionate hardship\, the hardship had to amount to a personalized risk to the applicants.\n \n[18]             The applicants submitted that if the immigration officer had properly considered all the factors as she was required to do\, the decision that there was no disproportionate hardship might be different.\n \nRespondent's Submissions\n \n\n  \n[19]             The respondent submitted that the immigration officer's notes demonstrate that she considered all of the evidence before her. There is no indication that the officer misconstrued any of the evidence. Immigration officers have ""considerable discretion"" when reviewing H  &  C applications and the fact that a positive decision could have been reached on the same facts is insufficient to show that the officer made any error when she exercised her discretion and refused the application.\n \nSufficiency of the Applicants' Establishment in Canada\n \n[20]             The respondent submitted that the applicants' submission that the immigration officer held them to too high a standard when she stated that there was insufficient evidence that the church they belong to ""could not function without their assistance""is incorrect. The respondent submitted that the applicants provided voluminous evidence including letters in support\, regarding their value to their church where they are members. The immigration officer's comments were simply in response to the statements in those letters. The immigration officer was not setting out an unobtainable standard of proof\, she was responding directly to the specific contents of the letters. The immigration officer cannot be faulted for responding to allegations in the evidence provided by the applicants.\n \nUnemployment in Korea:\n \n\n  \n[21]             The respondent submitted that the applicants' argument that the immigration officer mentioning the Korean recession in her notes is evidence that the immigration officer misconstrued the concerns the applicant had regarding age discrimination and employment in Korea\, is incorrect. The argument is based on a microscopic reading of the immigration officer's notes.  The immigration officer's notes clearly show that she was fully cognizant of the applicant's concerns about finding employment in Korea at his age. The immigration officer correctly characterized the applicant's fear that he is no longer employable because of his age and that the age discrimination that exists in Korea is a form of social persecution.\n \n[22]             It was open to the immigration officer to note the facts that Korea is experiencing a recession and that many other older Koreans experience the same type of employment problems as the applicant's concerns by simply mentioning these facts.\n \nBest Interests of the Children\n \n[23]             The respondent submitted that the applicants' argument that the immigration officer did not give the children due consideration is not supported by the evidence. The immigration officer's notes clearly show that she fully considered the situation of the children\, including the fact that they were in their formative years when their parents made the decision to come to Canada.\n \nRelevant Statutory Provisions \n \n[24]             Subsection 11(1) of IRPA requires a foreign national to apply for a visa before entering Canada:\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n11. (1) A foreign national must\, before entering Canada\, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if\, following an examination\, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.\n\n  \n11. (1) L'_tranger doit\, pr_alablement _ son entr_e au Canada\, demander _ l'agent les visa et autres documents requis par r_glement\, lesquels sont d_livr_s sur preuve\, _ la suite d'un contr_le\, qu'il n'est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme _ la pr_sente loi.\n\n\n\n\n \n[25]             Subsection 25(1) states:\n\n\n  \n25. (1) The Minister shall\, upon request of a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act\, and may\, on the Minister's own initiative\, examine the circumstances concerning the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to them\, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected\, or by public policy considerations.\n\n  \n25. (1) Le ministre doit\, sur demande d'un _tranger interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas _ la pr_sente loi\, et peut\, de sa propre initiative\, _tudier le cas de cet _tranger et peut lui octroyer le statut de r_sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des crit_res et obligations applicables\, s'il estime que des circonstances d'ordre humanitaire relatives _ l'_tranger - compte tenu de l'int_r_t sup_rieur de l'enfant directement touch_ - ou l'int_r_t public le justifient.\n\n\n\n \nAnalysis and Decision\n \n[26]             On the basis of Baker\, supra\, and the cases that followed it\, I am satisfied that the immigration officer's decision should be reviewed on the reasonableness simpliciter standard.\n \n[27]             I propose to deal first with Issues 2 and 3.\n \n[28]             Issue 2\n\n  \nDid the immigration officer err in fettering his discretion in deciding that the applicants were not sufficiently established in Canada?\nThe immigration officer's notes stated in part when dealing with the applicants' establishment in Canada:\nEven though they are valued members of the congregation\, insufficient evidence has been provided to state they are a significant benefit\, that a great loss to the church would occur and that the church could not function without their assistance.\n \n \nI have perused the material in the tribunal record and I cannot find any evidence or argument that the church could not function without the wife's assistance\, other than a letter at page 236 of the tribunal record\, which states in part\, ""Specially\, as a music family\, the most church's musical services are depend on them."" [sic] The immigration officer seemed to require that the church could not function without their assistance in order to use this factor towards deciding the sufficiency of the applicants' establishment in Canada. This is too high a standard to impose and one that most applicants could not meet. The applicants' activity in their church could count towards their degree of establishment in Canada\, even if the church could still function without their assistance. I am of the opinion that the immigration officer made a reviewable error in this respect as I cannot determine what the immigration officer's decision would have been had she properly taken this activity into account in her consideration of the application.\n \n[29]             Issue 3\nDid the immigration officer err in not considering the best interests of the children?\n\n  \nThere is no doubt that the immigration officer must properly consider the best interests of the children. In Hawthorne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1687 (C.A.) (QL)\, Evans J.A. stated at paragraphs 31 and 32:\nCounsel agreed that\, under the legal test established by Baker and Legault for reviewing officers' exercise of discretion\, the refusal to grant Ms. Hawthorne's H  &  C application could be set aside as unreasonable if the officer had been ""dismissive"" of Suzette's best interests. On the other hand\, if the decision maker had been ""alert\, alive and sensitive"" to them (Baker\, at paragraph 75)\, the decision could not be characterized as unreasonable.\n \n \nIt was also common ground that an officer cannot demonstrate that she has been ""alert\, alive and sensitive"" to the best interests of an affected child simply by stating in the reasons for decision that she has taken into account the interests of a child of an H  &  C applicant (Legault\, at paragraph 12). Rather\, the interests of the child must be ""well identified and defined"" (Legault\, at paragraph 12) and ""examined ... with a great deal of attention"" (Legault\, at paragraph 31). For\, as the Supreme Court has made clear\, the best interests of the child are ""an important factor"" and must be given ""substantial weight"" (Baker\, at paragraph 75) in the exercise of discretion under subsection 114(2).\n \n \nAnd at paragraph 40:\n. . . failed to give the careful consideration to the best interests of Suzette that is required by law. As Baker and the guidelines indicate\, it is certainly necessary for the decision maker to consider the seriousness of the harm that a parent's removal is likely to cause to a child. However\, unless the decision maker considers the degree of harm in the context of the best interests of the child\, she is likely to be diverted from her duty to be ""alert\, alive and sensitive"" to this important factor in the exercise of discretion. . . .\n \n \n \n[30]             With respect to the children\, the immigration officer stated:\nClient states his children would have difficulty readjusting to Korean school standards and experience hardship from loss of a social network (stimulus). I acknowledge the children have taken advantage of the opportunities available to them to discover world experiences\, but insufficient evidence has been provided to state similar experiences are not available in Korea. The children came to Canada during their formative years and are still in their formative years. Insufficient evidence has been provided to state they could not adjust to the school system they left behind. The older child has one year left in college and could finish school on her own and apply her skills in Korea.\n \n \n \n[31]             The immigration officer failed to address some issues concerning the children. How would the lack of extended family and community in Korea effect the social support the children would have in Korea? How would the father's inability to obtain employment in Korea effect the children and their educational opportunities? The immigration officer\, when speaking of the older child stated that the older child could finish her last year of college on her own and apply her skills in Korea.  If the child is to do this\, the question arises - where will she live\, and who will support her if her father is unemployed in Korea?\n \n[32]             When considering the best interests of the children\, weighing of the relevant factors is required to determine the best interests of the children. That was not done in this case. In my opinion\, the immigration officer was not ""alert\, alive and sensitive"" to the best interests of the children.  Accordingly\, the immigration officer's decision is not reasonable and must be set aside.\n \n[33]             Because of my findings on these two issues\, I need not address the remaining issues.\n \n[34]             The application for judicial review is therefore allowed and the matter is remitted back to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n \n[35]             The respondent did not wish to present any proposed question for my consideration for certification as a serious question of general importance.\n \n[36]             The applicants proposed the following question for my consideration for certification as a serious question of general importance:\nIf the unusual and undeserved hardship standard is assessed by officers on section 25 H  &  C applications pursuant to section 6.6 of the Immigration Manual upon the hardship of having to apply for a permanent resident visa from outside Canada\, what is the bearing of an applicant that clearly cannot apply or qualify for permanent residency outside Canada on the final determination?\n \n \n \nI am not prepared to certify this question as it is not determinative of this case.\n \n                                                 ORDER\nIT IS ORDERED that:\n 1.          The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is remitted back to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n 2.

I-2\, as amended\, was denied.\n [2]                 The applicant requests that the decision of the immigration officer be quashed. The applicant further requests that this matter be sent back for redetermination by a different officer with instructions that the redetermination be made in accordance with the findings and directions of this Court.\n [3]                 The applicant requests costs of this application on a solicitor-and-client basis.    \nBackground\n [4]                 The applicant is a citizen of Jamaica. In October 1997\, the applicant arrived in Canada and made a Convention refugee claim.\nConvention Refugee Determination Division Proceedings\n [5]                 On October 21\, 1998\, the Immigration and Refugee Board (Refugee Division)\, determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee.\n [6]                 By letter dated January 13\, 2000\, the applicant was informed that it had been determined he was not a member of the Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada class (""PDRCC"").\n [7]                 On February 25\, 2000\, and May 2\, 2001\, the applicant's motions for an order staying the execution of his deportation order were dismissed.\n [8]                 The Refugee Division subsequently re-opened the applicant's refugee claim on the grounds there were problems with respect to his first refugee hearing.\n [9]                 By reasons dated May 15\, 2002\, the Refugee Division again determined that the applicant was not a Convention refugee. On September 9\, 2002\, the applicant's application for leave and judicial review regarding this decision was dismissed.\nHumanitarian and Compassionate Grounds Application\n [10]            On April 19\, 2001\, the applicant applied for processing within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n [11]            On December 19\, 2001\, the applicant had an interview with an immigration officer regarding his application. The applicant\, his counsel and his Minister\, Reverend Martin Garniss\, attended the interview.\n [12]            In her Notes to File - Decision and Reasons\, dated December 19\, 2001\, the immigration officer wrote:\n\n\n. . . Client's sister left Jamaica in 1993\, was found to be a Convention Refugee in 1994 and was landed in Canada in 1995. . . .\n \nClient lives with friend in Ottawa. Client is involved with his Church and performs volunteer work from time to time. Other than Church activities client is not involved in the community. Client has not worked since 31October 2000. I am not satisfied that the degree of establishment in Canada is sufficient to cause unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship for the client if returned to Jamaica for processing abroad. \n \nMr. Donaldson has one sister and two aunts in Canada. He has two children (ages 17  &  21) and former spouse in Jamaica\, all who he remains regular contact with. He also has six siblings\, two aunts and one uncle in Jamaica. All family members are fine . . . Client maintains that he fears return to his homeland because his sister would not assist drug smugglers in Jamaica and he as a family member was targeted; however other family members are not being harmed. Significant ties to homeland exist and likely that client would receive some type of support from family members upon return. I have fully considered the applicant's allegations that he would face persecution upon return to Jamaica . . .\n \n. . .\n \nClient has submitted a letter from his Doctor stating that he is being treated for severe bilateral glaucoma.\n \nFollowing the interview I provided Mr. Donaldson and his counsel time to provide any additional information they cared to.    Also offered to answer any questions client might have.\n \nI am not satisfied that any economic or social hardship exists to waive A9(1). I am not satisfied that there is proof that PC faces an identifiable risk or threat for his life\, security or general well being by being required to leave Canada and apply for landing from his homeland. I am not satisfied that unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship exists.\n \n [13]            By letter dated December 20\, 2001\, the immigration officer informed the applicant that his application for processing from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was denied.\n [14]            This is the judicial review of the decision of the immigration officer.\n\n\nApplicant's Submissions\n [15]            The applicant submits the lack of a meaningful opportunity to present evidence related to a humanitarian and compassionate (""H  &  C"") application and to have that evidence fully and fairly considered constitutes a denial of procedural fairness. The applicant submits the immigration officer disregarded the evidence of Rev. Garniss and was not interested in providing an opportunity to have that evidence presented. It is submitted that the immigration officer conducted herself in an unprofessional and unfair manner and thereby denied the applicant the opportunity to present his case fully and fairly.\n [16]            The applicant submits that the conduct and comments of the immigration officer during the interview create a reasonable apprehension of bias. It is submitted that the applicant was denied a hearing in accordance with natural justice and that the officer had an issue or problem with the applicant that she did not disclose. It is submitted that the immigration officer's affidavit\, memo and reasons are not a true and accurate account of what occurred during the applicant's interview.\n\n\n [17]            The applicant submits that there are inconsistencies between the immigration officer's various statements. It is submitted that the immigration officer's reasons and affidavit do not indicate that she provided Rev. Garniss with an opportunity to provide evidence\, but that her memorandum indicates she did. It is submitted that these inconsistencies indicate a lack of care and veracity on the part of the immigration officer\, and that the evidence of the applicant should be preferred over the evidence of the respondent.\n [18]            The applicant submits the immigration officer provided inconsistent evidence and is not being truthful as to when and why she shredded her handwritten notes from the interview. The applicant believes these notes may have been relevant and should likely have been included in the certified tribunal record.\n [19]            The applicant submits that the timing and veracity of the immigration officer's memo dated March 4\, 2002\, is questionable as the term ""Immigration Counsellor"" was used and this was not a designation until the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 became effective on June 28\, 2002.\n [20]            The applicant submits the immigration officer was obligated to disclose the negative PDRCC report\, and provide the applicant with an opportunity to comment\, prior to relying on it.\n\n\n [21]            The applicant submits the decision of the immigration officer is unreasonable as the evidence shows the applicant had established himself considerably in Canada and that he faces disruption of his community and family ties\, loss of support and separation from his sister\, and a serious threat of bodily harm if returned to Jamaica. It is submitted that his sister's children will lose the care and support of their uncle. It is submitted that the conduct of the immigration officer\, coupled with the lack of any clear evidence to the contrary\, leads to the conclusion that the decision of the immigration officer was not reasonable or based on reason.\n [22]            The applicant submits that special reasons exist in this case\, arising from the conduct of the immigration officer\, which warrant the awarding of costs pursuant to Rule 22 of the Federal Court Immigration Rules\, 1993\, S.O.R./93-22\, as amended. The applicant therefore requests costs of this application on a solicitor-and-client basis.\nRespondent's Submissions\n [23]            The respondent submits the fact the applicant would be leaving behind friends\, family\, employment or a residence is not generally sufficient to constitute hardship and thus warrant a positive H  &  C application.\n\n\n [24]            The respondent submits the immigration officer respected and applied the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. It is submitted that at all times during the interview the immigration officer conducted herself in a professional manner and that the evidence confirms her account of what occurred at the interview. The respondent submits that the applicant was given a meaningful opportunity to present full and complete written submissions in relation to his case and therefore the immigration officer satisfied the requirements of the ""participatory rights"" required by the duty of fairness. The respondent submits the manner in which an interview is conducted is within the immigration officer's discretion and that it was entirely appropriate for the immigration officer to tell Rev. Garniss not to answer questions on the applicant's behalf. In any event\, the respondent submits the decision indicates evidence submitted by the applicant was fully and fairly considered by the immigration officer. It is also submitted that the applicant has not specified what evidence he was prevented from presenting to the immigration officer or how such evidence was crucial to his case. The respondent submits that there is no duty on immigration officers to interview H  &  C applicants\, nor is there a duty to seek clarification of information that an applicant submitted in support of his application.\n [25]            The respondent submits the actions of the immigration officer do not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. It is submitted that the decision of the immigration officer clearly demonstrates that she had an open mind and considered the totality of the applicant's submissions free from any stereotypes and bias. It is submitted that an informed person would note that the decision of the immigration officer mentioned the positive aspects of the applicant's application. It is submitted that the immigration officer clearly indicated that the notes of the interview were destroyed on or about December 20\, 2001.\n\n\n [26]            The respondent submits the immigration officer did not improperly rely on the negative PDRCC decision. It is submitted that the immigration officer merely noted that the applicant's PDRCC decision was denied in January 2000 and that this does not indicate that she fettered her discretion or failed to independently consider the evidence before her. As the reasons for the negative PDRCC decision do not form part of the certified tribunal record\, the respondent submits there is no evidence the immigration officer relied on or considered the decision when rendering her decision. In any event\, it is submitted that while the applicant in this case was not provided with a copy of the risk opinion\, he was informed of its existence and result\, and had ample opportunity to present evidence relevant to his case. As such\, it is submitted the immigration officer did not err by not providing the applicant with a copy of the Post Claim Determination Officer's risk opinion.\n [27]            The respondent submits the applicant has failed to establish that the immigration officer's decision is unreasonable. It is submitted that the immigration officer's decision is founded on the evidence and facts of the case and is supported by reasons that can withstand a somewhat probing examination. It is submitted that the applicant assumed the risk of establishing himself in Canada while his immigration status was uncertain and he cannot now contend that the hardship of being required to leave is unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate.\n [28]            The respondent submits no special reasons have been made out which would warrant departure from the general rule that costs are not payable in respect of judicial review applications involving immigration matters. It is submitted there is no basis for the awarding of solicitor-client costs.\n \n\n  \nIssues\n1.          Did the conduct of the immigration officer breach the requirements of fairness or natural justice by failing to provide\, or otherwise unreasonably interfering with\, the applicant's ability to present his case?\n2.          Did the conduct of the immigration officer during the interview give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias or otherwise breach the requirements of fairness?\n3.          Did the Board err in fact\, or breach the requirements of natural justice\, by not disclosing the report of the Post Claim Determination Officer (""PCDO"") on which she relied for comment\, prior to finding there was no risk?\n4.          Was the decision of the immigration officer unreasonable?\nRelevant Statutory Provision\n [29]            The relevant sections of the Immigration Act\, supra\, state as follows:\n\n\n \n 9. (1) Except in such cases as are prescribed\, and subject to subsection (1.1)\, every immigrant and visitor shall make an application for and obtain a visa before that person appears at a port of entry.\n    \n 9. (1) Sous r_serve du paragraphe (1.1)\, sauf cas pr_vus par r_glement\, les immigrants et visiteurs doivent demander et obtenir un visa avant de se pr_senter _ un point d'entr_e.\n     \n\n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n \n  \n114.(2) The Governor in Council may\, by regulation\, authorize the Minister to exempt any person from any regulation made under subsection (1) or otherwise facilitate the admission of any person where the Minister is satisfied that the person should be exempted from that regulation or that the person's admission should be facilitated owing to the existence of compassionate or humanitarian considerations.\n\n  \n114.(2) Le gouverneur en conseil peut\, par r_glement\, autoriser le ministre _ accorder\, pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire\, une dispense d'application d'un r_glement pris aux termes du paragraphe (1) ou _ faciliter l'admission de toute autre mani_re.\n\n\n \n\n \nAnalysis and Decision\n [30]            Issue 1\nDid the conduct of the immigration officer breach the requirements of fairness or natural justice by failing to provide\, or otherwise unreasonably interfering with\, the applicant's ability to present his case?\n\n\nThe central dispute in this application is what transpired at the applicant's interview with the immigration officer. The applicant's Minister came to the interview to give evidence about the applicant's church activities and about his establishment within their community. The Minister had a doctor's appointment scheduled within one half hour of the beginning of the interview so a request was made for him to give his evidence prior to the immigration officer completing her questioning of the applicant. The applicant and his Minister both state that the immigration officer got upset and said that she was conducting the interview and that it would be conducted her way. There seems to be agreement that the Minister answered a question directed at the applicant. According to the applicant\, this also upset the immigration officer. The Minister stated in his affidavit that when it was almost time to leave for his appointment\, counsel asked the immigration officer if the Minister could give his evidence before the officer finished her questioning. According to the Minister\, the immigration officer lost her temper and began to yell. The Minister stated that he then left the interview. The applicant\, in his affidavit\, generally confirms these facts.\n [31]            The immigration officer\, on the other hand\, states that the Minister told her what his evidence would be. She states that she asked the applicant a question and the Minister answered it. After\, she states that she politely reminded the Minister that she expected the applicant to answer the question and that the Minister then became angry and abruptly left the interview. The immigration officer\, in her memo-to-file\, which was attached to her affidavit\, states that she did not raise her voice\, yell\, exhibit angry behaviour or lose her temper.\n [32]            I am satisfied that the Minister did answer a question that was directed at the applicant. I am also satisfied the immigration officer did point out to the Minister that he should not answer the question. I am also satisfied that\, at best\, if the officer's testimony is to be accepted\, she only received evidence from the Minister about the applicant's church involvement and about the applicant's eye problem. The decision makes no reference to evidence concerning the applicant's establishment in their community.\n [33]            The applicant and his Minister were not cross-examined on their affidavits. I note that on reviewing the immigration officer's Notes to File - Reasons and Decision (dated December 19\, 2001) and in her affidavit\, there is no reference as to giving the applicant's Minister an opportunity to present evidence other than the reference in the memo-to-file where the officer stated ""at this time point the Reverend told me about Mr. Donaldson's involvement in the church and offered his support regarding the occupation."" From a perusal of the affidavit material\, I am of the opinion that the applicant's Minister was not afforded an opportunity to present all of the evidence that he wished to present on behalf of the applicant and consequently\, the duty of procedural fairness was breached and the decision must be set aside and the matter remitted to a different officer for reconsideration.\n [34]            Because of my finding in Issue 1\, it is not necessary to deal with the other issues.\n [35]            Neither party wished to propose a serious question of general importance for certification.\n [36]            I have considered the applicant's submissions with respect to costs and I am not prepared to make any award of costs.\n [37]            The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is to be submitted to a different officer for reconsideration.\n\n\nORDER\n [38]            IT IS ORDERED that the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is to be submitted to a different officer for reconsideration.\n                                                                                                ""John A.

In July 1999\, the applicant's mother came to Canada from Libya. The applicant's mother's refugee claim was accepted in February 2001. She subsequently applied for permanent residence status in Canada\, including the applicant as a dependent.  The immigration officer reviewing the application found that the applicant did not meet the definition of dependent as described in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration Regulations\, 1978\, S.O.R./78-172 since he was able to support himself out of his inheritance.\n \n[4]                 In November 2002\, the applicant submitted an H  &  C application\, seeking an exemption from the statutory requirement that he apply for permanent residence outside of Canada\, on the basis that it would be a great hardship for his mother and himself if he were required to leave Canada in order to apply for permanent residence. \n \n\n  \n[5]                 In June 2003\, the immigration officer requested further documentation with respect to the applicant's H  &  C application. In response\, the applicant forwarded additional documentation on July 9\, 2003 and July 17\, 2003.  On July 15\, 2003\, the immigration officer reviewed the applicant's H  &  C application and decided not to grant him an H  &  C exemption.\n \nThe Immigration Officer's Decision\n \n[6]                 The immigration officer determined that she was not satisfied that the applicant's personal circumstances were such that the hardship of having to obtain a permanent resident visa from outside Canada would be either unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.\n \n[7]                 In particular\, the immigration officer found that the applicant's mother was not incapable of caring for herself in Canada\, that the applicant and his mother had lived apart for more than a year recently\, and that the applicant's mother was receiving financial assistance from the Canadian government. The immigration officer was not satisfied that the applicant's return to Libya would cause him disproportionate hardship since he had skills and funds available to assist him. Further\, the immigration officer was not satisfied that the applicant would be at personal risk if returned to Libya.\n \n[8]                 The immigration officer acknowledged the applicant's establishment in Canada\, but found that it was insufficient in and of itself to grant him an H  &  C exemption.\n \n \n\n  \n \nApplicant's Submissions\n \n[9]                 The applicant submits that the standard of review applicable to the immigration officer's decision is reasonableness.\n \n[10]             The applicant submits that the immigration officer ignored the additional evidence submitted by the applicant by letter dated July 17\, 2003\, and that therefore\, the matter should be referred back to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n \n[11]             The applicant submits that the immigration officer relied upon irrelevant evidence or misinterpreted the evidence in concluding that the applicant's mother would be capable of caring for herself in Canada. The applicant contends that his mother's ability to manage his inheritance and arrange for his study in Canada was not evidence that she was resourceful\, but rather was evidence that she was a desperate woman who feared for her life and that of her son.\n \n\n  \n[12]             Moreover\, the applicant contends that the immigration officer failed to consider the fact that the since the applicant's mother arrived in Vancouver\, the applicant has paid for the rent and his mother's expenses\, and that his mother's social assistance does not cover her expenses. The applicant also alleges that the immigration officer erred in making the assumption that the applicant's mother will continue to receive financial aid.  The applicant also contends that he is prepared to work and support his mother\, but cannot do so because he is not entitled to apply for a work permit.\n \n[13]             The applicant also submits that the immigration officer misinterpreted the evidence in determining that the separation of the applicant and his mother would not cause them any hardship. The applicant alleges that their separation between January 1998 (when the applicant came to Canada on a student visa) and July 1999 (when the applicant's mother was able to leave with the consent of her abusive and threatening husband) was beyond their control.\n \n[14]             The applicant alleges that the immigration officer erred in concluding that the applicant would not be targeted by his mother's husband or her husband's family members\, and that the immigration officer misinterpreted the documentary evidence regarding Libya which suggests that the military regime of Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi monopolizes political power in Libya\, and would endanger the lives not only of the applicant's mother\, but of the applicant as well.\n \n[15]             Furthermore\, the applicant submits that the immigration officer erred in considering that the applicant's establishment in Canada was not a factor to be considered in assessing the hardship that he would experience if he were to be returned to Libya. The applicant's movable and immovable assets are all located in Canada (apartment and car)\, and the applicant has no immediate family living in Libya.\n \n\n  \n \n[16]             Finally\, the applicant submits that the immigration officer erred by considering evidence of the applicant's education\, skills\, and funds that would assist him in resettling in Libya. The applicant contends that this evidence is irrelevant to the determination of whether the applicant and his mother will suffer hardship due to their separation\, and that greater emphasis should have been placed upon their need for family support and the dangers faced by the applicant should he be forced to return to Libya.\n \nRespondent's Submissions\n \n[17]             The respondent submits that the standard of review applicable to the immigration officer's decision is reasonableness.\n \n[18]             The respondent submits that there is no evidence that the information contained in the applicant's further affidavit (or any of the documents attached to it) was before the immigration officer when she made her decision\, and that such information should not be considered in this application for judicial review: Asafov v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, _1994_ F.C.J. No. 713 (T.D.)(QL); Lemiecha (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, _1993_ F.C.J. No. 1333 (T.D.)(QL).\n \n \n\n  \n \n[19]             The respondent submits that the applicant is essentially requesting that the Court re-weigh the evidence before the immigration officer\, which is not the role of a reviewing Court.\n \n[20]             The respondent alleges that there was evidence before the immigration officer that would have enabled her to reasonably conclude that the applicant's mother was not incapable of caring for herself (i.e. she had cared for both herself and the applicant in the past). Contrary to the applicant's arguments\, the immigration officer recognized that their separation would be difficult for the applicant and his mother\, but concluded that such separation would not constitute undue or disproportionate hardship given the fact that they had lived apart for more than a year recently. The respondent also contends that the immigration officer considered the economic support arguments raised by the applicant.\n \n[21]             The respondent submits that the immigration officer's conclusion that the applicant would not be at personal risk in Libya was reasonable since the applicant had failed to provide evidence that he\, unlike his mother\, had suffered mistreatment in Libya. Furthermore\, the respondent notes that the applicant had not sought refugee protection.\n \n\n  \n[22]             The respondent submits that the immigration officer did not find that the applicant's establishment in Canada was irrelevant to his H  &  C application\, rather she found that his establishment was insufficient\, in and of itself\, to warrant an H  &  C exemption. The applicant chose to attend school in Canada\, and therefore\, any hardship resulting from him having to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada was not the result of circumstances beyond his control\, and the applicant should have been aware that he might have to leave Canada in order to apply for permanent residence status. Moreover\, the respondent contends that evidence relating to the applicant's financial situation was clearly material to the hardship that might be suffered by the applicant if returned to Libya\, and was properly considered by the immigration officer.\n \nRelevant Statutory Provisions\n \n[23]             Subsection 11(1) of IRPA requires that application for permanent residency be made outside of Canada:\n\n\n\n  \n11. (1) A foreign national must\, before entering Canada\, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if\, following an examination\, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act.\n\n  \n11.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817.\n \n \n\n  \nFurther Affidavit Evidence\n \n[27]             It is trite law that\, generally speaking\, evidence that was not before the immigration officer when she made her decision cannot be introduced on an application for judicial review: Lemiecha and Asafov\, supra. Accordingly\, any evidence in the applicant's further affidavit that was not before the immigration officer with the exception of the July 17\, 2003 letter from the applicant to officer A. Baker\, is not admissible on the judicial review application.\n \n[28]             Issue\nWas the immigration officer's decision not to grant the applicant's H  &  C application reasonable?\nI wish to first deal with the issue of the July 17\, 2003 letter from the applicant to the immigration officer. This letter contained further information as to how the applicant cared for his mother. This letter was not considered by the immigration officer\, as the officer made her decision on July 15\, 2003. The officer had informed the applicant by her letter dated June 25\, 2003 that he had thirty days from the date of the letter to provide further information to the officer. The July 17\, 2003 letter was sent within the thirty day time period but the immigration officer had already made her decision.\n \n\n  \n[29]             I note from the letter that the applicant paid for portions of his mother's dental bills and that a phone number had to be changed because of fear of the applicant's mother's husband who was calling the applicant and his mother and threatening both of them. I do not know how this information may have influenced the immigration officer's decision. I am of the view that it was a breach of the duty of fairness to make a decision on the applicant's claim before the time period for providing further information had expired. The time period was set by the immigration officer.\n \n[30]             Because of my finding\, I will not deal with the other arguments raised by the application.\n \n[31]             The application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n \n[32]             Neither party wished to propose a serious question of general importance for my consideration.\n \n                                                                         ORDER\n \n[33]             IT IS ORDERED that the application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred to a different immigration officer for redetermination.\n \n                                                                               \n               ""John A.

She attended ESL classes for two months and applied and obtained an extension of her status for six months to conduct business and market research.\n \n[4]                 In February 1998\, the applicant married her first husband\, Gordon Mullins\, a Canadian citizen. In March 1998\, Mr. Mullins sponsored the applicant's first H  &  C application for permanent residence in Canada.\n \n[5]                 In May 1998\, Mr. Mullins passed away. After his death\, the applicant sought and obtained an extension of her visitor's visa for the purpose of dealing with legal problems in relation to Mr. Mullins' estate.\n \n[6]                 On September 29\, 1998\, the applicant's first H  &  C application was refused.\n \n[7]                 In September 2000\, the applicant made a Convention refugee claim\, alleging a fear of persecution if she were to return to China based on her participation in Falun Gong. This claim was refused in January 2002. The applicant did not seek judicial review of this decision.\n \n[8]                 In March 2001\, the applicant married Raymond Joel\, a Canadian citizen.\n \n[9]                 In July 2001\, with the support of Mr. Joel's sponsorship\, the applicant applied for permanent residence and requested a discretionary and exceptional exemption pursuant to section 25 of the Act from the requirement under subsection 11(1) of the Act that she apply for an immigration visa outside of Canada.\n \n[10]             On June 24\, 2002\, the applicant and Mr. Joel attended an interview with the immigration officer.\n \n[11]             On October 18\, 2002\, the immigration officer refused the applicant's H  &  C application.\n \n[12]             She was not satisfied that there were sufficient reasons to waive the requirement of subsection 11(1) of the Act. She also determined that the applicant's marriage to Mr. Joel was not bona fides\, and that the applicant's goal in coming to Canada was to remain permanently.\n \n\n  \n[13]             The applicant argues that the immigration officer exhibited a reasonable apprehension of bias. According to the applicant\, the immigration officer made insensitive and racist comments\, bullied the applicant\, and was dishonest. The reasons attempt to disguise as reasonable\, a decision which based on the immigration officer's comments and conduct at the interview\, was decided in advance of the interview.\n \n[14]             On the other hand\, the respondent argues that there is no evidence of bias on the part of the immigration officer. The respondent relies on the affidavit of the immigration officer\, in which she indicates that she conducted the interview in a polite and professional manner.\n \n[15]             The test for a reasonable apprehension of bias was set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al.\, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369. The Court stated at page 394:\n[...] the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one\, held by reasonable and right minded persons\, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal\, that test is ""what would an informed person\, viewing the matter realistically and practically--and having thought the matter through - conclude. [...]\n \n \n \n[16]             In Au v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2001] F.C.J. No. 435 (Q.L.)\, Nadon J. held that the standard applied to determine a reasonable apprehension of bias will vary depending on the nature\, role and function of the tribunal. With respect to decisions by visa officers\, since they are not acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity\, a less stringent standard should apply\, one which requires an absence of conflict of interest and a mind that is open to persuasion.\n \n[17]             In the case at bar\, the affidavits of the applicant\, Mr. Joel\, and the immigration officer provide a depiction of the interview that is completely different. On cross-examination on affidavit\, the applicant and Mr. Joel continued to insist that the immigration officer made inappropriate comments and gestures during the interview\, whereas the immigration officer denied all the allegations made against her.\n \n[18]             The applicant relies on the case of Parihar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1991)\, 50 F.T.R. 236 in support of her argument that this Court should prefer her version of events. In this case\, there was a dispute over whether the immigration officer had given the applicants an opportunity during the interview to explain inconsistencies. Reed J. held that insofar as memory is concerned\, one would expect that the individuals being interviewed would have a clearer memory of what occurred\, it being a unique experience for them\, than the person doing the interviews. As a result\, she decided to accept the version of events as set out in the applicants' affidavits.\n \n[19]             In my opinion\, the present case is different in the sense that it is not a detail of the interview that is being disputed but rather the conduct of the immigration officer.\n \n\n  \n[20]             Furthermore\, contrary to the applicant's submissions\, the fact that the immigration officer's notes are not detailed does not mean that I should prefer the statements made by the applicant and Mr. Joel in their affidavits. The immigration officer's notes are not intended to be a transcript of the interview.\n \n[21]             The applicant's allegations with respect to the immigration officer's conduct at the interview have all been denied by the immigration officer in her affidavit and in cross-examination on affidavit. There is nothing in the immigration officer's notes and Report to File that raises a reasonable apprehension of bias. There is also nothing in the immigration officer's decision that raises a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n \n[22]             I note that the alleged improper conduct was reported only after the immigration officer's decision. Neither the applicant nor Mr. Joel ever communicated their allegations to the immigration officer or to her supervisor\, even though they both sent the immigration officer correspondence after the interview\, seeking an early decision to the applicant's H  &  C application. The cross-examination of the applicant shows some inconsistencies which may be explained by the fact that her version of the facts is solely based on her memory.  Furthermore\, in cross-examination\, Mr. Joel admitted that he was medicated during the interview and that he was ""annoyed\, surprised and hurt"" when the immigration officer asked questions regarding the bona fides of his marriage to the applicant which may have coloured his perception of what took place.\n \n\n  \n[23]             Of importance is the fact that both the applicant and Mr. Joel testified on cross-examination on affidavit that they left the interview with the expectation of a positive decision\, not a refusal. If the allegations of the applicant and Mr. Joel with regard to the immigration officer's statements and conduct during the interview were true\, it is difficult to see how they could have left the interview with such a positive impression.\n \n[24]             In my view\, despite the fact that the parties disagree over what actually transpired during the interview\, it still remains that in matters of judicial review\, the burden is on the applicant to show that the tribunal has not complied with procedural fairness or has not acted fairly or reasonably (Fehr v. Canada (National Parole Board) (1995)\, 93 F.T.R. 161. Based on the evidence before me\, I am not satisfied that the applicant has succeeded in establishing that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the immigration officer.\n \n[25]             For these reasons\, this application for judicial review is dismissed with costs.\n \n                                                 ORDER\n \nTHIS COURT ORDERS that the application for judicial review is dismissed with costs.\n \n \n \n \n                                                           (Sgd.)

This application was refused\, as an immigration officer concluded that Ms. Masanganise would not face excessive hardship if she were required to apply for landing from abroad.\n\n  \n \n[2]                 Ms. Masanganise now challenges this decision\, contending that the immigration officer erred in failing to consider the obvious risk that she would face if she were to return to Zimbabwe\, and in failing to request a risk assessment. She further submits that the immigration officer applied too high a standard of proof in connection with her application. Finally\, Ms. Masanganise submits that the immigration officer erred considering her employment experience in relation to her employability abroad\, rather than as evidence of her establishment in Canada.\n \n \nStandard of Review\n \n \n[3]                 The general standard of review governing decisions of immigration officers in relation to H  &  C applications is reasonableness simpliciter: Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817. That is\, the decision must be able to withstand a ""somewhat probing examination"": Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.\, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748.                    \n \n[4]                 However\, the question of the appropriate standard of proof to be applied in relation to the assessment of risk is a question of law. In my view\, the standard of review to be applied to questions of law in the H  &  C context is correctness. However\, my conclusion in this case would be the same\, whether I applied the standard of correctness or that of reasonableness. \n \n \n\n  \nIssue 1: Did the Immigration Officer Properly Deal with the Issue of Risk?\n \n[5]                 Ms. Masanganise's initial H  &  C application was filed on September 20\, 2001. She noted in her application that the situation in Zimbabwe had deteriorated since her refugee claim was determined\, and that she still feared persecution in her home country.\n \n[6]                 Ms. Masanganise's application was accompanied by a letter from her then solicitor\, who stated that since Ms. Masanganise's refugee claim was refused:\n[T]he government of Zimbabwe has become more repressive\, a fact that is now universally acknowledged. There is also ample evidence now that western countries are flooded with Zimbabwean refugee claimants. There is also a high success rate of claimants from Zimbabwe. Were Ms. Masanganise's claim to be heard now\, she is more likely to succeed. She still fears persecution in Zimbabwe\, particularly now that the government is aware that she has claimed refugee status.         \n \n \n \n[7]                 Ms. Masanganise heard nothing with respect toher application for some fourteen months. In December of 2002\, she received a letter from the immigration officer. Amongst other things\, Ms. Masanganise was asked to provide the immigration officer with details as to why she was unable to apply for permanent residence from outside Canada\, and the hardship that she would incur by doing so.\n \n[8]                 Ms. Masanganise responded to this request\, providing additional information in support of her application. With respect tothe issue of risk\, Ms. Masanganise provided a second letter from her solicitor\, this one dated December 14\, 2002. This letter states\, in part:\n\n  \nAfter her claim was turned down\, the whole world realised that Zimbabwe is a very repressive country and refugee claims in Canada received close to a 100% acceptance rate. For the past two years\, all my clients from Zimbabwe have been accepted. Britain stopped returning failed refugee claimants from Zimbabwe in January 2002. Returned refugee claimants have been known to get arrested and detained upon arrival in Zimbabwe. Some were known to have been tortured\, held in indefinite detention or simply vanished. If Ms. Masanganise's claim was heard now\, it would be successful.\n \n \nThere are credible reports of human rights violations in all major and reputable publications emanating from all sources in respect of Zimbabwe. I refer you particularly to the US Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights (2002 for 2001). Ms. Masanganise's fears are well founded and the refugee system in Canada currently has recognized this\, as have all western countries. [emphasis added]                                 \n \n \n \n[9]                 A few days later\, Ms. Masanganise was sent a letter by the immigration officer\, advising that her application for an exemption would not be granted. The relevant portion of the'FOSS' notes of the immigration officer state:\nSUBJECT IN CDA SINCE 08/1998. FAILED HER REF CLAIM. LAWYER STATED THAT IF SHE WERE MAKING HER REF CLAIM NOW\, SHE WOULD ALMOST POSITIVELY BE ACCEPTED AND THAT CLAIMANTS FROM ZIMBABWE HAVE AN ALMOST 100% SUCCESS RATE. ALSO HE STATES THAT SOME ZIMABAWEANS [SIC] HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BE TORTURED AND HELD INDEFINITELY WHEN RETURNED THERE. THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WHICH CAN UPHOLD THE NOTION THAT SUBJECT WILL SUFFER DIRECT OR PERSONALIZED RISK IF SHE IS TO RETURN TO HER COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.\n \n \n \n[10]             The respondent submits that Ms. Masanganise did not claim to face a personalized risk if she were returned to Zimbabwe. According to the respondent\, Ms. Masanganise made general observations as to the poor human rights record of the current government in Zimbabwe\, but failed to tie those comments to her own situation. As a consequence\, a risk assessment was not required in this case.\n\n  \n \n[11]             In support of this argument\, the respondentrelies on the decision of Justice Gibson in Khan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 1778. In Khan\, the sum total of the applicant's evidence with respect tohis alleged fear of persecution was the following statement ""I have fear of persecution in the country of Pakistan. Cannot go back to Pakistan and now am married. Do not want to stay away from my wife.""\n \n[12]             The immigration officer denied Mr. Khan's request for an H  &  C exemption\, noting that the officer ""... did not feel that he [the applicant] would suffer any unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship\, by being required to submit an application at a visa office outside Canada ..."".\n \n[13]             Justice Gibson found that the very limited evidence provided by Mr. Khan with respect to his alleged fear of returning to Pakistan\, when coupled with previous\, negative decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board\, meant that the brief comment of the immigration officer was sufficient\, and that no further analysis was required.\n \n\n  \n[14]             While I have considered the respondent's submissions carefully\, I am satisfied that the decision in Khan is distinguishable from this case on its facts.  First of all\, Ms. Masanganise alleged that there had been a significant deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe since her refugee claim was decided. As a result\, the negative decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board would be of limited relevance some three years later\, in the context of her H  &  C application.\n \n[15]             I do agree with the respondent that Ms. Masanganise's initial submissions consisted of little more that the type of generalized statement that we see in the Khan case\, and that if there had been nothing more before the immigration officer\, no further analysis on his part would have been required. It is simply not enough to rely on the poor human rights record in an applicant's country of origin as proof that the applicant herself would suffer persecution if she were returned to that country.\n \n[16]             In this case\, however\, we have more. Counsel's December 14\, 2002 letter clearly identifies a specific\, personalized risk that Ms. Masanganise claims she would face if she were returned to Zimbabwe as a failed refugee claimant.\n \n\n  \n[17]             A PRRA assessment is not required in every H  &  C case where personalized risk is claimed:  Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, (2000)\, 186 F.T.R. 155\, and Nacsa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FC 91. Given the paucity of information before the immigration officer in relation to Ms. Masanganise's claim of risk\, it was certainly open to the officer to weigh the evidence and to determine that there was simply not enough there to warrant the matter being referred to a PRRA officer for a full risk assessment. However\, it is not clear to me from my review of the immigration officer's FOSS notes that the officer ever addressed the risk allegedly arising out of Ms. Masanganise's membership in the class of failed refugee claimants. To that extent\, I am satisfied that the immigration officer was in error.\n \n[18]             I do not need to determine whether this error\, on its own\, would be sufficient to warrant the decision of the immigration officer being set aside. As will be seen below\, the error was compounded by the imposition of an unduly high standard of proof on Ms. Masanganise.\n \nIssue 2:  Did the Immigration Officer Apply the Wrong Standard of Proof?\n \n[19]             The Immigration Officer found that there was ""insufficient evidence that the applicant will suffer direct and personalized risk if returned to Zimbabwe"" (emphasis added). Ms. Masanganise submits that this shows that the immigration officer failed to give proper consideration to the probability of risk as opposed to its certainty\, and thereby committed an error of law. According to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Adjei v. Canada  [1989] 2 F.C. 680\, 57 D.L.R. (4th) 153\, the test to be used is whether there is a 'reasonable chance' that persecution would take place. An applicant does not have to show that she had previously suffered persecution\, or will suffer persecution in the future\, only that she has good grounds for fearing persecution. Ms. Masanganise submits that she has met this test.\n \n\n  \n[20]             The respondent contends that Ms. Masanganise's argument presumes that an assessment of risk was conducted against the Convention Refugee definition. It also presumes that the words ""that subject will suffer"" connotes a standard of certainty. The respondent submits that\, on the contrary\, the immigration officer's observations merely indicate that Ms. Masanganise failed to meet the evidentiary threshold required to trigger a risk assessment. \n \n[21]             I do not agree. \n \n[22]             The immigration officer's reasons state that officer was not satisfied that Ms. Masanganise ""will suffer direct and personalized risk if returned to Zimbabwe"". In my view\, this clearly indicates that the immigration officer applied an unduly high standard in evaluating Ms. Masanganise's claim.\n \n[23]             In the context of refugee claims\, the current state of the law is that a claim based on section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act is assessed in accordance with the Adjei standard. Where a claimant asserts that they are a person in need of protection under section 97 of the Act\, the claim is assessed on the balance of probabilities standard: Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2003 FC 1514. There is nothing in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to indicate that the risk component of an H  &  C analysis should be evaluated in accordance with a different standard. \n \n[24]             As a result\, I am satisfied that the immigration officer applied an incorrect standard in his evaluation of the risk aspect of Ms. Masanganise's H  &  C application.\n\n  \n \nConclusion\n \n[25]             In light of the two errors that I have identified in the immigration officer's analysis\, I am of the view that the H  &  C decision must be set aside\, and the matter remitted to a different immigration officer for redetermination. It is not necessary to address the other issues raised by Ms. Masanganise.\n \nCertification\n \n[26]             The respondent proposes the following question for certification:\nIf an allegation of risk is made before an H  &  C officer and that risk is not explained or supported by the evidence\, does that allegation have to be referred to risk assessment officer for consideration?\n \n \n \n[27]             Counsel for Ms. Masanganise submitted that the proposed question does not raise a serious issue of general importance\, and as such should not be certified.              \n \n[28]             In the context of the decision under review in this case\, I am not persuaded that the proposed question is of general importance. The answer to this question will undoubtedly be restricted to the facts that would be before the Court of Appeal\, and would not be of general application. As a result\, I decline to certify the question.\n \n \n\n  \n \n                                                 ORDER\n \nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n1.

No serious question of general importance is certified.\n \n \n \n                                                                   \n                              Judge\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n \n \nFEDERAL COURT\n \nName of Counsel and Solicitors of Record\n \n \nDOCKET:                                            IMM-273-03\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                SHARAI MASANGANISE\nApplicant\n \nand\n \nTHE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND\nIMMIGRATION\nRespondent\n                                                                       \nDATE OF HEARING:                        JULY 13\, 2004\n \nPLACE OF HEARING:                      TORONTO\, ONTARIO\n \nREASONS FOR ORDER\nAND ORDER BY:                              MACTAVISH J.\n \nDATED:                                               JULY 20\, 2004\n \n \nAPPEARANCES BY:\n \nMr. Kingsley Jesuorobo\nFOR THE APPLICANT\n \nMr. Martin Anderson\nFOR THE RESPONDENT\n \nSOLICITORS OF RECORD:\n \nKingsley Jesuorobo\nBarrister  &   Solicitor\nNorth York\, Ontario\nFOR THE APPLICANT                                                                                                        \nMorris Rosenberg\nDeputy Attorney General of Canada                   FOR THE RESPONDENT\n\n  \n \n \n               FEDERAL COURT\n \n \n                                    Date: 20040720\n \n                          Docket: IMM-273-03\n \n \nBETWEEN:\n \n \n \nSHARAI MASANGANISE\n \nApplicant\n \n \n \nand\n \n \n \nTHE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND\nIMMIGRATION\n \nRespondent\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nREASONS FOR ORDER AND ORDER\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n You are being directed to the most recent version of the statute which may not be the version considered at the time of the judgment.\n\n\nContinue \n\n\n\nDo not display this message anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",immigrationFederal Court Decisions,Quan v.

The first reason was her finding that Mr. Thai's commitment to the applicant was based on a knowledge of her that was incomplete in several important areas. The second reason was Mr. Thai's failure to provide credible evidence that this was a genuine marriage and one of substance. The third reason was based on other information considered and\, in particular\, the immigration officer taking into consideration and weighing very heavily the fact the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration issued her opinion the applicant is a danger to the public and\, as a result\, any humanitarian and compassionate factors that may exist were outweighed by the seriousness of the applicant's criminality.\n\n [5]                In support of her first reason\, the immigration officer stated that\, at the interview\, it was established Mr. Thai was unaware of the applicant's common law relationship with another man from approximately 1991 to 1993. The immigration officer noted the applicant told the intake officer at the Edmonton Institution for Women about her common law relationship but made no mention of her involvement with Mr. Thai whom she met in March 1996.\n\n [6]                Another factor which the immigration officer took into account to reach her conclusion that Mr. Thai did not know the applicant well was the fact Mr. Thai told the immigration officer the applicant was pregnant with his child and she had an abortion in September/October 1998 but he was told about the abortion only after it had taken place.\n\n [7]                To reach her conclusion on the first reason\, the immigration officer also said Mr. Thai was not able to provide specific details of the applicant's criminal conviction.\n\n\n\n [8]                The immigration officer based her finding of Mr. Thai's failure to provide credible evidence the marriage was genuine and one of substance upon the following factors:\n(1)        Mr. Thai informed the immigration officer that his parents\, siblings and close friends were unaware of the marriage;\n(2)        the immigration officer reviewed marriage photos and reception/dinner photos with Mr. Thai who informed the immigration officer that his family members in the dinner photos were not aware of the occasion;\n(3)        Mr. Thai advised the immigration officer he maintained a household with the applicant after their marriage but the immigration officer noted the applicant stated in her application that they resided together whenever possible. Mr. Thai\, when confronted\, explained to the immigration officer that the applicant had leased an apartment near the residence he shared with his family and that they spent every day together\, at either one place or the other.\n\n\n\n [9]                As noted\, in respect of the third reason\, the immigration officer found the seriousness of the applicant's criminality outweighed any H  &  C factors that may exist. The immigration officer also took into account the fact Mr. Thai provided the Parole Board with a written statement informing them the applicant had worked for him on a part-time basis and that he was willing to employ her when she was released from detention. The immigration officer noted this employment was not listed as part of the complete work history required on her application for visa exemption.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n [10]            The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has been authorized by the Governor in Council to waive Immigration Act requirements if satisfied there are humanitarian and compassionate factors for such a waiver.\n\n [11]            The Minister has issued guidelines to immigration officers who make decisions on applications for exemption on H  &  C grounds.\n\n [12]            The ministerial guidelines state what is meant by ""humanitarian and compassionate grounds"". The guidelines say this:\n6.1 What is meant by ""humanitarian and compassionate grounds""\n                                                     . . .\nApplicants bear the onus of satisfying the decision-maker that their personal circumstances are such that the hardship of having to obtain an immigrant visa from outside of Canada in the normal manner would be (i) unusual or undeserved or (ii) disproportionate.\n\n\n\n [13]            The Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, considered in depth several legal issues surrounding decisions on applications for exemption of the Immigration Act requirements based on H  &  C considerations.\n\n [14]            This is what Justice L'Heureux-Dub_ wrote about the guidelines at paragraph 16 of Baker\, supra:\nThe guidelines constitute instructions to immigration officers about how to exercise the discretion delegated to them. These guidelines are also available to the public.\n\n [15]            Later on\, in her reasons for judgment\, Justice L'Heureux-Dub_ said this about the guidelines at paragraph 72 when examining whether the decision before her was unreasonable. She wrote the following:\n. . . immigration officers are expected to make the decision that a reasonable person would make\, with special consideration of humanitarian values such as keeping connections between family members and avoiding hardship by sending people to places where they no longer have connections. The guidelines show what the Minister considers a humanitarian and compassionate decision\, and they are of great assistance to the Court in determining whether the reasons of Officer Lorenz are supportable. They emphasize that the decision-maker should be alert to possible humanitarian grounds\, should consider the hardship that a negative decision would impose upon the claimant or close family members\, and should consider as an important factor the connections between family members. The guidelines are a useful indicator of what constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the power conferred by the section\, and the fact that this decision was contrary to their directives is of great help in assessing whether the decision was an unreasonable exercise of the H  &  C power.\n\n\n\n [16]            The ministerial guidelines\, at paragraph 8.1.1\, deal with spouses of Canadian citizens and\, in particular\, spouses sponsored as members of the family class which is the case here. This is what the guidelines provide:\n8.1.1      Spouses sponsored as members of the family class\n\nCanada's long-term policy has been facilitation of admission for those spouses in Canada sponsored by their Canadian citizen or permanent resident spouses.\n\nFirst of all determine\n\n  _            Has a sponsorship been submitted and approved?\n\nIf so\, the applicant is a potential member of the family class and this can be considered as a favourable H  &  C factor.\n\nThen consider \n\n  _            Is the marriage genuine? That is\, a marriage with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse and not entered into for the primary purpose of remaining in Canada or gaining admission as a member of the family class. You may wish to consider\n\n -          The legality of the marriage\n\n-           The circumstances and timing of the marriage. For example\, did the marriage take place after the applicant was refused a visitor extension or when removal was imminent?\n\n  _            How long has the couple been in the relationship?\n\n  _            The religious\, social and cultural norms of the applicant's community.\n\n  _            Previous dealings with the Department that might be relevant.\n\nFor example\, a previous marriage of convenience\, enforcement action\, refused immigration applications\, or misrepresentation.\n\n  _            Any other factors that you believe to be relevant to your decision.\n\n [17]            Counsel for the applicant argued three grounds in support for setting aside the immigration officer's decision:\n\n\n(1)        error of law\, namely\, in concluding the marriage was not genuine\, the evidence available to the immigration officer does not support the twofold test set out in Horbas v. Minister of Employment and Immigration\, [1985] 2 F.C. 359\, namely first\, whether the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of obtaining admission to Canada\, and secondly\, whether the sponsored spouse has the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse;\n(2)        the fettering of her discretion when the immigration officer ruled the H  &  C factors were outweighed by the applicant's previous criminality coupled by the fact there was no assessment of the H  &  C factors put forward by the applicant; and\n(3)        the immigration officer made erroneous findings of fact when she found that Mr. Thai was unable to provide details of the applicant's criminal convictions and made an unreasonable finding of fact when she decided the marriage was not genuine.\n\n [18]            Apart from the issue of the fettering of discretion\, as I see it\, the grounds advanced by the applicant essentially attack the reasonableness of the immigration officer's decision based on a standard of review of reasonableness simpliciter as established in Baker\, supra.\n\n\n\n [19]            An unreasonable decision\, Justice L'Heureux-Dub_ said in Baker\, supra\, is how Justice Iacobucci viewed it in Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.\, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at paragraph 56 in these words:\nAn unreasonable decision is one that\, in the main\, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly\, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect\, if there is one\, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it.\n\n\n [20]            It is useful to recall what Justice L'Heureux-Dub_ said in Canadian Union of Public Employees\, Local 301 v. Montreal (City)\, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 793\, about reviewing factual findings. She wrote at paragraph 85:\nWe must remember that the standard of review on the factual findings of an administrative tribunal is an extremely deferent one ... Courts must not revisit the facts or weigh the evidence. Only where the evidence viewed reasonably is incapable of supporting the tribunal's findings will a fact finding be patently unreasonable.\n\n\n [21]            I agree with counsel for the respondent that the nature of the decision in Horbas\, supra\, is quite different than the characteristics of the decision before the immigration officer which is essentially a discretionary decision.\n\n\n\n [22]            In Horbas\, supra\, the visa officer rejected a sponsored application for permanent residence based on a finding the spouse was not a member of the family class because of subsection 4(3) of the Immigration Regulations (the ""Regulations""). According to that provision\, the family class does not include a spouse who entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse.\n\n [23]            When a visa officer is deciding whether a person is a member of the family class on the basis of subsection 4(3) of the Regulations\, the visa officer is applying a legally binding regulation and determining whether the facts before him/her meet the legislative standards.\n\n [24]            An immigration officer\, when deciding whether an exemption from section 9 of the Immigration Act should be granted to a sponsored spouse is involved in making a discretionary decision based on ministerial guidelines. Those ministerial guidelines\, while directing an immigration officer to examine the genuineness of the marriage\, do so on a different basis and on a consideration of wider factors than would a visa officer interpreting subsection 4(3) of the Regulations. That said\, an immigration officer must exercise his/her discretion on a sound evidentiary foundation.\n\n\n\n [25]            In this case\, the immigration officer was simply not satisfied for the purposes of the decision she was making that the applicant and her sponsor had advanced sufficiently strong evidence the marriage was genuine. Based on the evidence she relied on\, this conclusion was\, in my view\, reasonably open to her. Counsel for the applicant has not been able to identify a reviewable defect in the evidentiary foundation for the decision as expressed in Southam\, supra\, applying the standard in C.U.P.E.\, supra.\n\n [26]            Counsel for the applicant argues the immigration officer failed to take into account the H  &  C factors in her favour (her nine years in Canada\, her rehabilitation\, no immediate family in Vietnam\, the difficult life in Vietnam and their marriage) as well as the fettering of her discretion by weighing in too heavily on her past criminality.\n\n [27]            I do not accept the applicant's submission that the immigration officer ignored the H  &  C factors advanced. The immigration officer's case summary identifies those H  &  C factors.\n\n [28]            Lastly\, the applicant has not made out a case for fettering of discretion. As I see it\, the real attack made here is that the immigration officer treated the criminality factor as decisive regardless of the presence or strength of countervailing H  &  C factors.\n\n\n\n [29]            I do not think such is the case. The immigration officer identified the H  &  C factors but found them insufficiently strong when gauged against her past criminality\, a factor which cannot be said to be irrelevant when considering whether the applicant should be exempted from the application of section 9 of the Immigration Act which requires an immigrant to make an application for and obtain a visa before that person appears at a Canadian point of entry. Evans J.\, as he then was\, reached a similar conclusion in Lukic v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (IMM-1515-98\, March 10\, 1999\, F.C.T.D.).\n\nDISPOSITION\n\n [30]            For all of these reasons\, this judicial review application is dismissed.

Due to substantial criminal activity over a lengthy period of time and his failure to attend an inquiry in February 1992\, the Applicant was ordered deported on June 7\, 1994.\n \n [3]                 The Applicant has applied for H  &  C consideration as per section 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. I-2 whereby the Minister may exempt any person from the regulations of subsection (1) or facilitate the admission of any person owing to the existence of compassionate or humanitarian considerations. Specifically\, the Applicant applied to have subsection 9(1) waived. Subsection 9 (1) requires that all immigrants apply and obtain an immigration visa prior to coming Canada.\n \n [4]                 The Immigration Officer decided that an exemption of subsection 9(1) would not be granted.\n \nThe Immigration Officer's Decision\n \n [5]                 In reaching her decision\, the Immigration Officer had substantial material before her including numerous letters from family and friends and a report of a psychologist.\n\n\n \n [6]                 By letter dated November 27\, 2001\, the Immigration Officer requested that the Applicant provide further information\, including a request to provide a letter from both Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous\, to substantiate his statement. In that letter\, the Immigration Officer also asked the following question:\nOther than having no convictions since 1997\, in what other way can you demonstrate that you have rehabilitated yourself?\n \n \nFurther\, the Immigration Officer asked whether the Applicant had any other charges or arrests since 1997.\n \n [7]                 Information that\, was at least partially responsive to this request\, was forwarded to the Immigration Officer. Through no fault of the Respondent\, the information did not reach the Immigration Officer. Accordingly\, her decision was made on the basis of the information before her.\n \n [8]                 The Immigration Officer decided that there were insufficient grounds to grant a waiver of the subsection 9(1) requirements.\n \n [9]                 The Immigration Officer noted that the Applicant had been in Canada for most of his life with his entire family\, that there was no remaining family in Portugal and that leaving his family would not be easy on him or his family. She\, nevertheless\, found that she ""was not satisfied that it constitutes undue or disproportionate hardship.""\n\n\n \n [10]            She found that:\nThe subject has an arrest record that dates back to 1983. He has been charged with over 45 offences; he has been convicted 21 times. Considering the subject's extensive criminal history\, I am not satisfied that being ""conviction free"" since 1997 is necessarily indicative of rehabilitation nor am I satisfied that the passage of time constitutes rehabilitation.\n \n \n \n [11]            Finally\, she decided that:\nI have carefully considered the impact this decision will have on the subject and his family. I have read their letters of support and pleas to give the subject a second chance. I can sympathize with the distress the subject's family has expressed over the thought of him returning to Portugal. No doubt\, they will be disappointed should he be ultimately removed to Portugal. While there are compelling humanitarian and compassionate factors\, I am not satisfied that they are sufficient to overcome the negative factors in this case. The subject has made declarations about himself and his rehabilitation however\, he has not provided sufficient evidence to support his assertions.\n \n \n \nArguments\n \n(a)        Applicant's Submissions\n \n [12]            The Applicant raised\, in his written submissions\, the issue of whether the Immigration Officer ought to have taken into account the information that was forwarded by the Applicant but not received; however during oral submissions\, the Applicant acknowledged that he would not pursue that argument further.\n \n [13]            The Applicant submitted that there was compelling evidence before the Immigration Officer that the Applicant was rehabilitated. Such evidence was contained in the letters provided by family and friends. There was also reference to rehabilitation in the psychologist's report. The compelling evidence also included the lack of a criminal record for over four years.\n \n [14]            In her reasons\, the Immigration Officer failed to explain why she concluded that the ""compelling humanitarian and compassionate factors"" were ""not sufficient to overcome the negative factors"".\n \n(b)        The Respondent's Submissions\n \n [15]            The Respondent submitted that the Immigration Officer's decision is not unreasonable and not in error and that the Applicant is merely seeking for the Court to re-weigh the evidence. The onus is on the Applicant to satisfy the Immigration Officer that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant a favourable recommendation. The Applicant must fully present his case with supporting documentation to the Immigration Officer. The Applicant's failure to do so does not create an error.\n \n\n\n [16]            There is no need for the Immigration Officer to mention or refer to all evidence in her reasons. It is submitted that the record contradicts the Applicant's arguments that the Immigration Officer did not consider the issue of rehabilitation. She was seeking further evidence and it was not provided to her.\n \n [17]            In the Respondent's submission\, the Immigration Officer noted all of the factors that weighed in favour of finding humanitarian and compassionate consideration in this case. She balanced that against his extensive criminal history and found that there were not sufficient humanitarian and compassionate reasons to grant the exemption.\n \nAnalysis\n \n [18]            For the reasons that follow\, I am of the view that this application should be allowed.\n \n [19]            The issue in this case is related to the Immigration Officer's view of the extent of rehabilitation. It is clear\, from her decision\, that she had no doubt about the ""compelling humanitarian and compassionate factors"" that weighed in favour of the Applicant. In her decision she carries on to state that:\nI am not satisfied that they are sufficient to overcome the negative factors in this case. The subject has made declarations about himself and his rehabilitation\, however\, he has not provided sufficient evidence to support his assertions.\n \n \n \nThus\, the issue of rehabilitation was determinative in the mind of the Immigration Officer.\n \n [20]            With respect to rehabilitation\, even without the information sought by the Immigration Officer\, there was substantial evidence before her. The letters of relatives and friends\, in addition to being ""letters of support and pleas to give the subject a second chance""\, contain significant information related to their view of the Applicant's rehabilitation. One of the letters was from an acquaintance at Alcoholics Anonymous. The psychologist's report also spoke to the Applicant's rehabilitation. Nowhere in the decision was there a specific reference to this important evidence.\n \n [21]            In the decision\, the only reference to the rehabilitation evidence before her is the following statement ""furthermore\, other than remaining without conviction since 1997\, he has not sufficiently demonstrated that he has rehabilitated himself"". On a simple reading\, this statement makes it obvious that the Immigration Officer failed to consider any other evidence related to the issue of rehabilitation. She could have made reference to the various assertions of the Applicant's rehabilitation contained in the letters and psychologist's report and dismissed them. She did not do so.\n \n\n\n [22]            It seems to me that the Immigration Officer is required to go beyond a simple acknowledgement of having reviewed all of the evidence where the information relates to a determinative issue in the Applicant's claim. In this view\, I am supported by various decisions of the Court (see\, for example\, Khan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] F.C.J. No. 332 (T.D.) (QL); Tse v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1995 F.C.J. No. 633 (T.D.)).\n \n [23]            This is not simply a matter of the weight that the Immigration Officer put on this factor; it is a demonstration that the Immigration Officer failed to consider the evidence that was before her. In my view\, this is a reviewable error.\n \n [24]            Accordingly\, I am of the view that this application should be allowed.\n \n \nORDER\n \nTHIS COURT ORDERS THAT this application is allowed.

The applicant's refugee claim was refused and an application for judicial review was dismissed by this Court.  [3]                 On February 12\, 1999 the applicant filed an application to waive the requirements of subsection 9(1) of the Immigration Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. I-2 (the ""Act"") on H  &  C grounds. He based his claim on his establishment in Canada\, the potential hardship he faced if he returned to Sri Lanka and the presence of his only brother in Canada. After the applicant attended an interview with immigration officer Lloyd on September 14\, 1999 his file was forwarded to a post determination claim officer (""PDCO"") to determine whether the applicant would be at risk if returned to Sri Lanka.\n [4]                 The PDCO rendered his risk opinion on November 21\, 2000\, finding the applicant would not be at risk if returned to Sri Lanka. The PDCO gave the applicant an opportunity to comment on errors and omissions regarding the negative risk opinion and the applicant's counsel submitted comments with supporting documentation from current newspapers showing a dramatic increase in violence and terror toward opponents of the government. After reviewing the additional submissions\, the PDCO declined to alter his opinion and passed both his risk opinion and the applicant's responses to the immigration officer.\n [5]                 The applicant was informed on June 4\, 2001 that his application had been refused. He seeks to have that determination set aside by way of judicial review.\n       \n\nISSUES\n[6]         Counsel for the applicant raised seven issues:\n(i)         whether the immigration officer erred in law in making an unreasonable decision that insufficient H  &  C grounds existed;\n(ii)        whether the immigration officer took into account irrelevant considerations in reaching her decision;\n(iii)       whether the immigration officer made an unreasonable decision by exclusively relying on the risk opinion prepared by the PDCO;\n(iv)        whether the officer erred in applying a reasonableness standard in reviewing the PDCO's opinion;\n(v)        whether the immigration officer erred in determining that the applicant would not face a risk on return to Sri Lanka;\n(vi)        whether the immigration officer erred in law in breaching the duty of fairness by unduly delaying the processing of this application; and\n(vii)       whether the immigration officer improperly fettered her discretion by applying a restrictive interpretation of H  &  C grounds.\n        Six of the seven issues are dismissed. The fifth issue is allowed.\n          \n\nRELEVANT LEGISLATION\n             \n[7]         The relevant provision to a determination on H  &  C grounds is subsection 114(2) of the Act\, which reads:\n\n\n114(2)Exemption from regulations\n \n(2) The Governor in Council may\, by regulation\, authorize the Minister to exempt any person from any regulation made under subsection (1) or otherwise facilitate the admission of any person where the Minister is satisfied that the person should be exempted from that regulation or that the person's admission should be facilitated owing to the existence of compassionate or humanitarian considerations.\n114(2) Idem\n(2) Le gouverneur en conseil peut\, par r_glement\, autoriser le ministre _ accorder\, pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire\, une dispense d'application d'un r_glement pris aux termes du paragraphe (1) ou _ faciliter l'admission de toute autre mani_re.\n\n\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n[8]         The appropriate standard when reviewing the decision of an immigration officer on an application based on H  &  C grounds is reasonableness simpliciter\, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at 857-858. The Court will not set aside a discretionary decision of an immigration officer\, nor substitute its decision for an officer's\, unless that decision was unreasonable or clearly wrong.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \nANALYSIS\n\nIssue No. 1     \n \n \nDid the immigration officer err in law in making an unreasonable decision that insufficient H  &  C grounds existed?\n \n[9]         The applicant submits the immigration officer erred because she conducted a ""disjunctive analysis"" and examined each factor supporting the application in isolation from the others. The Court finds there is no basis for the applicant's argument on this point. The officer examined the relevant evidence put before her and engaged in the process of weighing that evidence. The officer listed the factors supportive of the application and those that pointed to a refusal in her decision\, and concluded:\nOn reviewing all the information and documentation presented I am not satisfied that Mr. Jinadasa's personal circumstances are such that the hardship of having to obtain an immigrant visa from outside Canada in the normal matter would be unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate.\n \nI am not satisfied that there exists sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant exception of Canada's immigration laws. As such\, Mr. Jinadasa's request for waiver of subsection 9(1) of Canada's Immigration Act is refused.\n \n[10]       Accordingly\, there is no basis to disturb the officer's finding that insufficient H  &  C grounds existed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \nIssue No. 2\n \n \nDid the immigration officer err in law by taking into account irrelevant considerations in reaching her decision?\n \n[11]       In his submissions to the immigration officer\, the applicant argued that the presence of his brother in Canada was a factor that supported his application. The immigration officer dealt with this by stating:\n \nI have considered Mr. Jinadasa's ties to Canada and am satisfied that his brother resides here and that they are close. However\, it is noted that Mr. Jinadasa has strong ties to Sri Lanka that include his spouse\, child and parents\, which is given significant weight.\n \n[12]       The applicant submits the immigration officer's consideration of his family ties to Sri Lanka was irrelevant. The applicant directed the Court to Mohamed v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1986] 3 F.C. 90. The applicant in Mohamed sought to have her mother accepted into Canada on H  &  C grounds. The applicant's claim was based on the Act's goal of family reunification. The immigration officer refused the application and stated that allowing it would not have furthered family reunification because the applicant's brother remained in India. The Court held the immigration officer erred by basing his decision on an irrelevant consideration.\n \n[13]       The Mohamed decision does not mean that the presence of family ties in one's country of origin is an irrelevant consideration in all H  &  C cases. Support for this position can be found in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Baker\, supra. at page 862\, paragraph 72:\n \n. . . immigration officers are expected to make the decision that a reasonable person would make\, with special consideration of humanitarian values such as keeping connections between family members and avoiding hardship by sending people to places where they no longer have connections.\n \n\n\nThe presence of family members in an applicant's country of origin is a relevant factor when determining whether an applicant would suffer hardship by being sent to a place where they no longer have connections. The comments of the officer regarding the applicant's family ties to Sri Lanka are properly viewed in this light. Therefore\, the immigration officer did not err by taking into account the presence of the applicant's family ties to Sri Lanka.\n \n \nIssue No. 3      \n\n \nDid the immigration officer made an unreasonable decision by exclusively relying on the risk opinion prepared by the PDCO?\n \n[14]       The applicant submits that the officer erred by directing the applicant's comments and submissions on the risk opinion back to the same PDCO rather than receiving and evaluating them herself.\n \n[15]       In Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] 4 F.C. 407\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 854 (QL)\, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the immigration officer had improperly surrendered her discretion to the PDCO by merely ""rubber-stamping"" the PDCO's risk assessment report. The Court stated at paragraph 36 that an applicant must be able to direct a response to the immigration officer because:\n \n. . . the decisive weight often likely to be given by immigration officers to risk assessment reports from PDCOs is a reason to ""level the playing field"" by permitting subsection 114(2) applicants to respond to them. Otherwise\, the influence on the decision maker of the submissions that they made in support of their application is likely to be greatly diminished by the report.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n[16]      Even though the applicant did not sent his responses directly to the immigration officer\, the applicant was given ample opportunity to draw the immigration officer's attention to any errors or omissions in the PDCO's report. After the PDCO received and reviewed the applicant's response to the initial negative risk opinion\, he passed both his risk opinion and the applicant's rebuttal to the\nofficer to review so she could make the final decision. Ms. Lloyd stated this in her affidavit and it is confirmed by the PDCO's memorandum to her dated December 7\, 2000. The applicant's counsel acknowledged that the immigration officer had received the applicant's rebuttal in a letter to the immigration officer dated March 2\, 2001:\n \nYou have before you the decision of [the PDCO] Mr. Allen and the rebuttal from our office with regard to risk. You are not bound by the decision of Mr. Allen in any way and therefore\, have the ability to consider both opposing viewpoints.\n \n[17]       The applicant argued that the officer was not open to receiving the applicant's response and as evidence of this highlighted the officer's statements in a letter dated January 8\, 2001: ""I have received and reviewed the risk opinion and I am not seeking information to revisit the risk; you have had the opportunity to rebut the officer conducting the risk opinion."" The Court does not agree with the applicant's argument. The immigration officer had fulfilled her obligation to allow the applicant to respond to the PDCO's risk assessment. She was not obligated to give the applicant an opportunity to re-argue his case\, see Haghighi at paragraph 37\, and did not err by indicating this in her letter.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \nIssue No. 4\n \nDid the officer err in applying a reasonableness standard in reviewing the PDCO's opinion?\n \n[18]       The applicant submits that the immigration officer erred by stating that she was satisfied that the PDCO's risk opinion was ""reasonable"". The applicant submits that this indicates the officer fettered her discretion as ""reasonableness"" was not the appropriate standard.\n \n[19]       The applicant's claim on this point is overly legal. While it is true that the officer referred to the PDCO's report as ""reasonable""\, it is evident that she was using ""reasonable"" simply as means of saying she accepted and agreed with the PDCO's finding. I do not think the officer intended to apply the term ""reasonable"" in the manner used when dealing with administrative law.\n \n \nIssue No. 5\n\n \nDid the immigration officer err determining that the applicant would not face a risk on return to Sri Lanka?\n \n[20]       The applicant submits that the PDCO officer erred by simply adopting the reasoning of the Convention Refugee Determination Division's (""CRDD"") decision on the applicant's refugee claim. The applicant contends that the PDCO's reliance on the CRDD's decision meant that issue of risk to the applicant if returned to Sri Lanka was not truly reassessed\, which undermines the purpose of an application on H  &  C grounds.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n[21]       The Federal Court of Appeal in Longia v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1990] 3 F.C. 288 held that facts may change or a political event may occur which can lead to a conclusion that a fear found by the CRDD not to be well-founded\, has now become reasonable. The remedy is not a new hearing before the CRDD\, but an application on H  &  C grounds under the Act. This is the situation faced by the applicant.\n \n[22]       The risk assessments dated November 21\, 2000 and December 7\, 2000 relied upon by the visa officer essentially repeat the findings of the CRDD in its decision dated October 10\, 1997. These risk assessments do not mention or analyse the new documentary evidence submitted by the applicant.\n \n[23]       The new documentary evidence included newspaper articles reporting a ""bone-chilling"" escalation in violence and terror directed against opponents of the Sri Lankan government. The newspaper reports refer to:\n \n(i)         the murder of a newspaper editor at his home;\n(ii)        a new terror campaign against activists of opposing political parties\, artists\, media personalities and intellectuals;\n \n(iii)       the assassination on January 4\, 2000 of a prominent Tamil politician and human rights lawyer; and\,\n \n (iv)              death threats against a prominent Sri Lankan\, who migrated to London following accusations that he had linked with the Tamil Tigers\, but returned to Sri Lanka in 1999.\n           \n\n[24]       In its decision\, the CRDD recognized that the applicant is a high profile Sri Lankan known to oppose the government\, and to sympathise and support the Tamil Tigers. Therefore\, the new documentary evidence he presented was important to his claim. As this evidence was not mentioned or analysed in the risk assessment reports or in the immigration officer's decision\, the Court is entitled to infer that the immigration officer made an erroneous finding of fact ""without regard to the evidence"". Mr. Justice Evans in Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425 (QL) at paragraph 17\, stated:\nHowever the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analysed in the agency's reasons\, the more willing a Court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact ""without regard to the evidence [...] In other words\, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus\, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding\, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion\, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact.\n        While the immigration officer was not required to refer to every piece of evidence in her decision\, as per Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992)\, 147 N.R. 317 (F.C.A.)\, [1992] F.C.J. No. 946 (QL)\, the immigration officer should have addressed the new documentary evidence presented by the applicant which contradicted the currency of the 1997 CRDD decision.\n          \n\n[25]       In Buri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 1358 at paragraph 22\, I held that the decision-maker is under an obligation to explain why the decision-maker discounted critical contradictory evidence presented by an applicant. See also Iqbal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] F.C.J. No. 568 (T.D.) (QL)\, Orgona v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 346\, Vaithilingam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 401\, Piel v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 562\, and Polgari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2001 FCT 626. The reasoning in these cases is applicable to the case at bar.\n[26]       The immigration officer made an erroneous finding of fact because she failed to consider or disregarded relevant evidence\, viz. the current newspaper evidence in assessing the risk of danger to the applicant if he returned to Sri Lanka. The officer also erred by adopting the CRDD's four year old assessment of risk\, and by failing to conduct an independent\, up-to-date risk assessment.\n        Issue No. 6\nDid the immigration officer err in law in breaching the duty of fairness by unduly delaying the processing of this application?\n\n[27]       The applicant argues the immigration officer breached the duty of fairness by unduly delaying the processing of his application. The respondent contends that the alleged delay could have been remedied by the applicant if he had sought an order of mandamus.\n        \n\n[28]       I agree with the position of the respondent. The issue of delay in a case where an applicant is seeking a benefit was dealt with in Gill v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1984] 2 F.C. 1025 (C.A.)\, where Mr. Justice Hugessen said at pages1028-29:\nIt may well be that the recently discovered administrative duty to act fairly encompasses a duty not unreasonably to delay to act; or\, put positively\, that the procedural duty to act fairly includes a duty to proceed within a reasonable time. It does not by any means follow\, however\, that the breach of such a duty would give rise to the setting aside of the tardy action when it is finally taken. The remedy surely is to compel timely action rather than to annul one that\, though untimely\, may otherwise be correct.\n[29]       Furthermore\, the applicant's claim must be accompanied by some evidence that an applicant has suffered some prejudice or unfairness as a result of the delay\, see Akthar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1991] 3 F.C. 32 (C.A.). As the Court has not been presented with any evidence of prejudice or unfairness to the applicant as a result of the delay\, I find for the respondent on this issue.\n \nIssue No. 7\nDid the immigration officer err in law by improperly fettering her discretion by applying an overly restrictive interpretation of H  &  C grounds?\n\n[30]       The applicant submits the immigration officer fettered her discretion by considering the absence of unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship to be determinative of the applicant's claim.\n       \n\n[31]       Based on the immigration officer's decision and her cross-examination\, the Court finds she considered the presence of unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship to be a determinative factor requiring a positive finding on H  &  C grounds. However\, the immigration officer's answers during cross-examination demonstrate that she did not view the absence of unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship as requiring a negative finding on H  &  C grounds. This is supported by her consideration of factors other than hardship in her decision\, notably the applicant's degree of establishment and the presence of his brother in Canada\, despite finding the applicant would not face unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to Sri Lanka. Accordingly\, the officer did not apply an overly restrictive approach to subsection 114(2).\n \n \n \nDISPOSITION\n[32]       For these reasons\, this application for judicial review is allowed\, the decision of the immigration officer is set aside and Mr. Jinadasa's H  &  C application shall be referred to another immigration officer and another Post Determination Claim Officer for an independent\, up-to-date risk assessment.\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                         (signed) Michael A.

After failing to persuade the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in his home state\, Mr. Singh filed an application for a Humanitarian and Compassionate (H  &  C) exemption. This too was denied. Mr. Singh now seeks judicial review of the decision denying him an H  &  C exemption.\n \nBackground\n[2]         Mr. Singh came to Canada on December 16\, 1990 and made a refugee claim immediately upon his arrival. Mr. Singh claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his religion\, his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group. Specifically\, Mr. Singh alleged that he would be imprisoned or killed by the Indian police because of his perceived involvement with the Khalistan Commando Force.\n \n[3]                  On December 4\, 1991\, the IRB determined that Mr. Singh was not a Convention refugee. His application for leave to appeal this decision was dismissed.\n \n[4]                  When Mr. Singh failed to appear for an interview with immigration authorities in 1994\, a warrant for his arrest was issued. Mr. Singh alleges that he did not receive notice to appear for the interview. Mr. Singh was arrested in July of 1998\, and he was subsequently released on payment of a bond.\n \n[5]                  In July of 1999\, Mr. Singh was interviewed by immigration authorities in order to prepare an application for a travel document for his return to India.\n \n[6]                  Mr. Singh submitted an application for an H  &  C exemption in February of 2000.    The basis for the application was Mr. Singh's assertion that it would be psychologically difficult for him to return India where he had been persecuted. Mr. Singh alleged that he had experienced feelings of frequent sadness\, crying spells\, hopelessness and loss of energy\, as well as heart palpitations\, shaking\, nightmares\, and difficulty sleeping\, all of which were associated with his fear of returning to India. In support of his application\, Mr. Singh filed a report from a psychologist which states that he suffered from post-traumatic anxiety and depression.\n \n[7]                  Mr. Singh asserted that he was well-established in Canada\, having been in the country for nine years. He further stated that he had a history of stable employment\, sound financial management\, integration into the community\, and professional and linguistic study in Canada\, as well as a good civil record. \n \n[8]                  On July 23\, 2002\, Mr. Singh was interviewed by a representative of Citizenship and Immigration Canada. He was told that he could apply for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) and he did so. Although the PRRA decision is dated November 1\, 2002\, Mr. Singh says that he was only advised on January 13\, 2002 that his PRRA application had been unsuccessful.\n \n[9]                  In the meantime\, on December 4\, 2002\, an immigration officer wrote Mr. Singh advising that his H  &  C application had been denied. Mr. Singh was not provided with the reasons for this decision until January 16th\, 2003\, in the form of a letter dated January 14\, 2003.\n \n[10]             On January 20\, 2003\, Mr. Singh was told that he was going to be removed from Canada on February 19\, 2003.    On February 6\, 2003\, this Court stayed Mr. Singh's removal\, pending the outcome of this application.\n \nThe H  &  C Decision\n[11]       The immigration officer makes the following observations in her decision:\n  _           Mr. Singh entered Canada in December 1990 using a forged British passport\, escorted by an agent;\n \n \n  _           he was determined not to be a Convention refugee in 1991 and his appeal of this decision was denied;\n \n \n  _           Mr. Singh's application under DROC (Deferred Removal Orders Class) was refused in March 1995; \n \n \n  _           Mr. Singh is deemed to be under a deportation order; and\n \n \n  _           Mr. Singh was arrested and released on a peace bond in 1998 with terms and conditions.\n \n \n \n[12]             The immigration officer then goes on to note that:\n  _                   Mr. Singh is married with no children\, he left his parents and four siblings behind in India and has no close relatives in Canada;\n \n \n\n  \n  _                   the psychological report gives the professional opinion that Mr. Singh is suffering from post-traumatic anxiety - the officer notes that Mr. Singh attended one session with the Psychologist\, and that there was no follow-up or referral for ongoing treatment;\n \n \n  _                   the IRB addressed Mr. Singh's fear of return to his country at length\, and concluded otherwise;\n \n \n  _                   the PRRA rendered a negative decision;\n \n \n  _                   Revenue Canada assessments for 1997\, 1998\, 1999 and 2001 were noted\, along with the observation that Mr. Singh's work permit expired in 1995\, and that he had been engaged in unauthorized employment contrary to the terms of his bond; and\n \n \n  _                   Mr. Singh had entered Canada on a forged passport\, and that the officer was not satisfied with his true identity\n \n \n \n[13]             The immigration officer concluded that there were insufficient H  &  C grounds to warrant granting the application for exemption\, as Mr. Singh would suffer no unusual\, undeserved\, or disproportionate hardship if he was required to leave Canada and return to India\, where he had a wife and family.\n \nIssues\n[14]       Mr. Singh raises four issues on this application:\n1)    Did the immigration officer err by ignoring and misinterpreting evidence?\n \n2)    Did the immigration officer take into account irrelevant matters in reaching her decision?\n \n3) Did the immigration officer err in dismissing the H  &  C application because she found that Mr. Singh was not well-established\, ignoring relevant and ample evidence of establishment? and\n \n4) Did the immigration officer breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose the risk assessment documents relied upon to Mr. Singh\, and by depriving him of the opportunity to respond to the assessment prior to reaching her decision?\n \n\n  \nStandard of Review\n[15]       The standard of review governing decisions of immigration officers in relation to H  &  C applications is reasonableness simpliciter. (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817)\n \n[16]             In Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.\, [1997 1 S.C.R. 748\, Iacobucci J. described an unreasonable decision as one:\n... that\, in the main\, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly\, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it.  The defect\, if there is one\, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it.\n \n \n \n[17]             With this understanding of the standard of review\, I turn now to the issues raised by Mr. Singh.\n \nAnalysis\n \nIssue 1: Did the immigration officer err by ignoring and misinterpreting evidence?\n \n[18]             Mr. Singh argues that the immigration officer minimized the importance of the psychological report submitted with his H  &  C application. He further contends that the immigration officer misconstrued the reasons of the IRB when she found that the Board had concluded that Mr. Singh did not have a subjective fear of persecution in his home state. Finally\, Mr. Singh says that the immigration officer fettered her discretion when she relied on decisions of the IRB and the risk assessment officer.\n\n  \n \n[19]             I am not persuaded that the immigration officer committed a reviewable error in relation to her treatment of the psychological report. The immigration officer considered the record carefully. She was alive to\, and aware of the risks to Mr. Singh's psychological and physical well-being. I cannot say that her conclusions in this regard were unreasonable.\n \n[20]             Insofar as the officer's reliance on the conclusions of the IRB is concerned\, a review of the Board's decision discloses that Mr. Singh's refugee claim was refused because the Board  found that Mr. Singh had a valid internal flight alternative. The Board made no finding as to the bona fides of Mr. Singh's subjective fear of persecution. Thus it appears that the immigration officer did misconstrue the evidence before her in this regard.\n \n[21]             Given my conclusion that there are other reasons for setting aside the immigration officer's decision\, I do not need to consider whether this error\, by itself\, was sufficiently material to warrant the Court's intervention.\n \n[22]             The question of the officer's reliance on the risk assessment will be addressed when I deal with issue 4.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \nIssue 2: Did the immigration officer take into account irrelevant matters in reaching\nher decision?\n \n[23]             Mr. Singh submits that the immigration officer committed a reversible error when she considered Mr. Singh's lack of identity documents at this stage in the H  &  C process.  According to Mr. Singh\, this is an irrelevant consideration during the assessment as to whether sufficient H  &  C considerations exist to warrant an exemption. Consideration of the identity issue should have been reserved to the second phase of the process dealing with the admissibility of the applicant.\n \n[24]             Given that the immigration officer was in receipt of the PRRA assessment\, Mr. Singh says that this error is all the more egregious as the immigration officer should have been aware that Mr. Singh's identity would have had to have already been satisfactorily established.\n \n[25]             Once again\, I am not persuaded that the immigration officer acted unreasonably in considering issues relating to Mr. Singh's identity. While the identity of an applicant will be a central issue in the admissibility phase of the process\, it does not mean that it is necessarily irrelevant at the first stage. The Ministerial guidelines governing H  &  C applications mandate that immigration officer should consider an application in light of all of the information known to the Department. In my view\, it was not unreasonable for the immigration officer to do so.\n\n  \nIssue 3:      Did the immigration officer err in dismissing the H  &  C application because she found that Mr. Singh was not well-established\, ignoring relevant and ample evidence of establishment?\n \n[26]             Mr. Singh submits that the immigration officer ignored ample evidence of his establishment in Canada. He refers to the general establishment guidelines that should be assessed on such an application (6.2 of Chapter IP 5 of the Inland Processing Manual)\, and explains how he says he meets each criteria. By concluding that he was not sufficiently established\, Mr. Singh submits that the officer must have ignored relevant information\, and therefore erred in law.\n \n[27]             Given the deferential standard of review afforded to decisions of H  &  C officers\, I am not persuaded that intervention is warranted in this regard. The officer was entitled to weigh the evidence before her. Although Mr. Singh pointed to factors that may have suggested a different result\, the officer's decision was open to her on the evidence. In particular\, the officer noted that (1) Mr. Singh is married and his wife and siblings all live in India; (2) neither Mr. Singh's wife nor his immediate family have experienced any difficulties with the Indian authorities in his absence; (3) Mr. Singh attended only one session with the psychologist; and (4) Mr. Singh worked after his work permit had expired and was therefore in breach of the terms of his bond. It was not unreasonable for the officer to have arrived at the decision that she did on the basis of all of these factors.\n \n\n  \nIssue 4:     Did the immigration officer breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose the risk assessment documents relied upon to Mr. Singh\, and by depriving him of the opportunity to respond to the assessment prior to reaching her decision?\n \n[28]             It is common ground that Mr. Singh was not provided with a copy of the negative PRRA report until after the decision had been made with respect to his H  &  C application.\n \n[29]             Mr. Singh submits that the immigration officer breached the duty of fairness owed to him by failing to disclose the risk analysis report to him for comment. The immigration officer referred to the negative PRRA report as one of the factors that she considered in reaching her decision to reject Mr. Singh's H  &  C application. Mr. Singh relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] 4 F.C. 407 as authority for the proposition that the failure of an immigration officer to provide an H  &  C applicant with a copy of a risk assessment\, and to allow the applicant the opportunity to respond to the findings therein\, prior to rendering a decision for landing on H  &  C grounds\, constitutes a breach of procedural fairness.\n \n\n  \n[30]             The respondent submits that there was no obligation on the immigration officer to give Mr. Singh the opportunity to comment on the findings of the PRRA officer prior to delivering her decision\, since there is no indication that the immigration officer relied on the PRRA decision. The respondent contends that the immigration officer did her own\, independent\, assessment of risk\, and referred to the PRRA decision only as chronological or background information.\n \n[31]             I am of the view that the failure of the immigration officer to provide Mr. Singh with a copy of the PRRA\, and to give him the opportunity to comment on the findings of the risk assessment\, in advance of making her decision on his H  &  C application was unfair to Mr. Singh. As a result\, the decision of the immigration officer should be set aside.\n \n[32]             In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that H  &  C applicants are owed more than a minimal level of procedural fairness. Considering a number of factors\, including the exceptionally serious ramifications that negative H  &  C decisions can have for an applicant\, the Court observed:\nRather\, the circumstances require a full and fair consideration of the issues\, and the claimant and others whose important interests are affected by the decision in a fundamental way must have a meaningful opportunity to present the various types of evidence relevant to their case and have it fully and fairly considered.\n \n \n \n[33]             In Haghighi\, the Federal Court of Appeal was asked to determine whether\, in cases where an H  &  C claim is based\, at least in part\, on a fear of persecution in an applicant's country of origin\, an immigration officer is required to disclose a negative risk assessment report received from another officer to the applicant\, and to provide the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the assessment before the final H  &  C decision is made.\n\n  \n \n[34]             In responding to this question\, Justice Evans noted that immigration officers are likely to give ""decisive weight"" to the opinions of risk assessment officers\, as a result of their relative expertise in assessing risk. Justice Evans also pointed out that if an applicant is not given the opportunity to respond to the risk assessment\, the influence that submissions made by the applicant may have on the decision-maker is likely to be greatly diminished by the risk report. He concluded by stating:\nIn my opinion\, the duty of fairness requires that inland applicants for H  &  C landing under subsection 114(2) be fully informed of the content of the PCDO's risk assessment report\, and permitted to comment on it\, even when the report is based on information that was submitted by or was reasonably available to the applicant.\n \n \n \n \n[35]             I do not accept the submission of the respondent that the immigration officer did her own independent assessment of risk\, and referred to the PRRA decision only as chronological or background information. Read in the context of the reasons as a whole\, it is clear that the negative PRRA decision was one of several factors that the officer considered in reaching her determination that Mr. Singh's H  &  C application would fail. Given the influential nature of risk assessments\, fairness required that Mr. Singh be afforded the opportunity to comment on the PRRA report prior to a decision being made with respect to his H  &  C application.\n \n[36]             For these reasons\, the decision of the immigration officer refusing Mr. Singh's H  &  C application should be set aside\, and the matter remitted to a different immigration officer for reconsideration.\n \nCertification\n[37]        Neither party has suggested a question for certification\, and accordingly none will be certified.\n \n                                                    ORDER\n \n1. The decision of the immigration officer is set aside\, and Mr. Singh's application for an H  &  C exemption is remitted to a different immigration officer for reconsideration; and\n \n2.    No serious question of general importance is certified.\n \n \n \n \n \n      ""Anne L.

F-7. The reasons for judgment are reported as Oberlander v. Canada (Attorney General) (2002)\, 22 Imm. L.R. (3d) 122 (F.C.T.D.).\n\n\nFacts\n [2]                 The appellant's citizenship was revoked on July 12\, 2001 by Order in Council P.C. 2001-1227 made under subsection 10(1) of the Citizenship Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. C-29. The appellant commenced an application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council to make the Order in Council (Trial Division File T-1505-01). The hearing of the judicial review is scheduled for June 23\, 2003.\n [3]                 On August 27\, 2001\, an immigration officer made a report under subsection 27(2) of the Immigration Act that the appellant is a person described in paragraph 27(2)(i) of the Immigration Act. Paragraph 27(2)(i) reads as follows:\n\n\n \n ... a person who ceased to be a Canadian citizen pursuant to subsection 10(1) of the Citizenship Act in the circumstances described in subsection 10(2) of that Act ...\n\n ... a perdu sa citoyennet_ canadienne conform_ment au paragraphe 10(1) de la Loi sur la citoyennet_ en raison de l'existence des circonstances vis_es au paragraphe 10(2) de cette Loi ...\n\n\n \n\n\n         [4]                 The issuance of the subsection 27(2) report led automatically to a direction under subsection 27(3) of the Immigration Act for an inquiry before the Adjudication Division of the Immigration Refugee Board. That inquiry may lead to a determination that the appellant has a right to remain in Canada\, or it may lead to a deportation order against the appellant.\n\n\n [5]                 If there is a deportation order\, the appellant will be subject to certain travel restrictions. However\, the deportation order will not be executed until the completion of further proceedings required by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 (which has replaced the Immigration Act). In addition\, counsel for the appellant indicated at the hearing of this appeal that the appellant's spouse and daughter have made an application to sponsor him\, and in connection with that application they have sought relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds from certain statutory conditions. It is my understanding that if that relief is granted\, the appellant will be permitted to remain in Canada while his family's sponsorship application is considered.\n [6]                 The immigration inquiry commenced on November 27\, 2001 and continued on March 26\, 2002. The adjudicator conducting the inquiry was not asked to adjourn the inquiry pending the application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council. A third sitting of the inquiry was scheduled for May 16\, 2002\, but before that date the appellant brought a motion in T-1505-01 for an order staying the immigration inquiry until completion of the application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council. The motion was dismissed\, which led to this appeal.\n [7]                 As indicated above\, the immigration inquiry began under the Immigration Act\, and was automatically continued by the Immigration Division when the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act came into force. Neither party has suggested that any of the differences between the two statutes are relevant to the issues in this appeal.\n\n\n [8]                 The immigration inquiry is not yet complete. The appellant has never asked the adjudicator to delay or adjourn the proceedings. Nor has the appellant sought leave to commence an application for judicial review of any decision made under the Immigration Act or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act relating to the inquiry.\nJurisdiction of the Trial Division\n [9]                 Counsel for the Crown argues that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Before dealing with that argument\, I will deal with the question of whether or not the Trial Division had the jurisdiction to consider the motion to stay the immigration inquiry. Apparently\, arguments relating to jurisdiction were made before him\, and he concluded that he had the requisite jurisdiction.\n [10]            Counsel for the Crown argues that the Trial Division had no jurisdiction to consider the motion to stay the immigration inquiry. The basis of his argument is that\, although the motion to stay the immigration inquiry purports to be an interlocutory matter in the application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council\, which is a proceeding under the Citizenship Act\, in substance it is an application for judicial review of an immigration matter\, which is barred unless leave is obtained under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (or its predecessor\, subsection 82.1(1) of the Immigration Act). Subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n 72(1) Judicial review by the Federal Court with respect to any matter - a decision\, determination or order made\, a measure taken or a question raised - under this Act is commenced by making an application for leave to the Court.\n\n 72(1) Le contr_le judiciaire par la Cour f_d_rale de toute mesure - d_cision\, ordonnance\, question ou affaire - prise dans le cadre de la pr_sente loi est subordonn_ au d_p_t d'une demande d'autorisation.\n\n\n \n\n\n         [11]            Counsel for the Crown submits that this provision is the clearest possible statement by Parliament that immigration matters are to proceed without judicial intervention except to the extent that leave is obtained from a judge of the Trial Division.\n [12]            Counsel for the appellant argues that the motion for a stay is an interlocutory motion in the application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council\, and as such is not affected by the leave requirements of the Immigration Act or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. She argues that since the motion for a stay was attached to the Governor in Council matter\, the jurisdiction of the Trial Division to hear the motion for a stay is found in section 18.2 of the Federal Court Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. F-7\, which reads as follows:\n\n\n \n 18.2    On an application for judicial review\, the Trial Division may make such interim orders as it considers appropriate pending the final disposition of the application.\n\n 18.2    La Section de premi_re instance peut\, lorsqu'elle est saisie d'une demande de contr_le judiciaire\, prendre les mesures provisoires qu'elle estime indiqu_es avant de rendre sa d_cision d_finitive.\n\n\n \n\n\n         [13]            She relies in the alternative on subsection 50(1) of the Federal Court Act\, which reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n \n 50(1)    The Court may\, in its discretion\, stay proceedings in any cause or matter\,\n(a) on the ground that the claim is being proceeded with in another court or jurisdiction; or\n(b) where for any other reason it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed.\n\n 50(1)    La Cour a le pouvoir discr_tionnaire de suspendre les proc_dures dans toute affaire_:\na) au motif que la demande est en instance devant un autre tribunal;\nb) lorsque\, pour quelque autre raison\, l'int_r_t de la justice l'exige.\n\n\n \n\n\n         [14]            An argument like the one made by counsel for the appellant was accepted in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)\, [1989] 2 F.C. 38 (T.D.). That case involved a stay of proceedings undertaken by the Minister of Justice under the Extradition Act\, R.S.C. 1970\, c. E-21. However\, the Extradition Act had no provision comparable to the leave requirement in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n [15]            Counsel for the appellant also points out that there are numerous cases in which the Trial Division has taken the position that it has the jurisdiction to stay the execution of deportation orders where no leave is sought to commence an application for judicial review of the deportation order itself. I do not propose to analyse the extensive jurisprudence relevant to this point. It is sufficient to say that in every case cited by counsel for the appellant\, the motion to stay the execution of the deportation order was grounded on some application for judicial review in relation to which leave was at least being sought under the Immigration Act.\n\n\n [16]            The purpose of the motion that is the subject of this case was to delay the immigration inquiry. The most straightforward means to that end would have been to ask the adjudicator to adjourn the inquiry until after the completion of the judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council. An adjournment might have been granted\, which would have precluded any need for recourse to the Trial Division. If the adjournment had been refused\, the refusal could have been the subject of an application for judicial review\, which would require leave.\n [17]            I agree with counsel for the Crown that the motion to stay the immigration inquiry was an attempt to have the Court intervene in an immigration matter without first obtaining leave as required by subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Such a tactic tends to undermine the purpose of the leave requirement. The judge would have been justified in finding an abuse of process\, and refusing on that ground alone to hear the motion or to grant the relief sought. In the circumstances\, however\, I am prepared to assume without deciding that the Trial Division had jurisdiction under section 18.2 of the Federal Court Act to consider the motion and deal with it on the merits.\nAppellate jurisdiction\n\n\n [18]            Under subsection 27(1) of the Federal Court Act\, this Court has the jurisdiction to hear an appeal from any judgment of the Trial Division unless there is a statutory bar. One such bar is the certified question requirement in paragraph 74(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (or its predecessor\, subsection 83(1) of the Immigration Act)\, which applies to judicial review in immigration matters. No question was certified in this case. However\, this matter proceeded in the Trial Division on the basis that it was not an immigration matter. Therefore\, no certified question was required and this Court has the jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nMerits of the decision to refuse the motion to stay the immigration inquiry\n [19]            There are three issues to be considered in relation to the merits of the motion to stay the immigration inquiry. First\, is there an arguable case on the application for judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council? Second\, will the appellant suffer irreparable harm if the immigration inquiry is not stayed? Third\, will the harm suffered by the appellant if the immigration inquiry is not stayed outweigh the harm suffered by the Crown if the immigration inquiry is stayed? An order staying the immigration inquiry is justified only if the answer to all three questions is yes.\n [20]            In the judicial review of the decision of the Governor in Council\, the appellant proposes to make a number of arguments. For the purposes of the motion to stay the immigration inquiry\, she relies on two of those arguments as illustrating an arguable case. One is that the Governor in Council misconstrued its mandate under section10 of the Citizenship Act. The other is that the Governor in Council erred in failing to give reasons for its decision. In my view\, these arguments meet the very low threshold for an arguable case in the context of a stay application.\n\n\n [21]            The material submitted by the appellant on the question of irreparable harm was aimed at establishing the stressfulness of the inquiry process and the prospect of deportation. The Judge found no irreparable harm. He gave a number of reasons\, but in my view the most compelling is that the motion to stay the immigration inquiry is premature because the inquiry might not lead to a deportation order\, much less a deportation. I agree with him on that point. In my view\, that justifies the conclusion that the appellant failed to establish irreparable harm.\n [22]            It is not necessary to consider the other arguments relating to irreparable harm\, or the arguments relating to the balance of convenience. This appeal should be dismissed.\n             ""Karen R.

Albert Nauman\, Immigration Programme Manager\, dated November 8\, 2000\, who refused the applicant's request for a waiver of the requirement to apply for landing outside of Canada based on humanitarian or compassionate considerations (H  &  C)\, as provided for in s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c. I-2.\n\n\n\n [2]                 The applicant is 57 years old\, a resident of the United States and retired. The applicant's wife is 58 years old and was a teacher before losing her eyesight in 1976. The applicant and his wife applied to be exempt from the requirement to apply for landing outside Canada based on H  &  C grounds\, in particular\, arguing that most of their family (mother\, brother and two sisters) live in Canada. The applicant argued that he would suffer disproportionate hardship if not re-united with his family in Canada. The Immigration Programme Manager refused the applicant's H  &  C application based on the following reasoning (tribunal record\, page 4):\nHumanitarian compassionate grounds exist when an applicant would suffer unusual\, undeserve or disproportionate hardship if required to meet normal immigration requirements for obtaining a visa. Although your client has a close personal relationship with relatives in Canada and wishes to join them\, I do not think that this is sufficient to invoke the humanitarian compassionate provisions of the Canadian Immigration Act. Even when using the criteria outlined in your letter\, ie factors which would ""excite a reasonable man in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of another so long as these misfortunes warrant the granting of special relief\,"" I fail to see the misfortune that would qualify your client for special relief. He is a comparatively wealthy man with legal status in the Unites States. He is not restricted from visiting his relatives in Canada as often as he chooses. Canadian immigration status is not necessary for him to maintain his relationship with his family. His entry to Canada pursuant to Section 114(2) of the Act must be refused.\n\n [3]                 Prior to the H  &  C application which is the subject of this judicial review\, the applicant had applied for permanent residence in Canada and was assessed by a visa officer\, Cyril Joseph\, as a retired person (NOC 9992.0). The applicant did not receive the required 70 units of assessment and was therefore refused. This decision is not under review in the current application. \n\n\n\n [4]                 Although the decision of visa officer Cyril Joseph is not under review\, the applicant\, in his record\, raises the argument in the current application that the visa officer committed a reviewable error by not exercising his positive discretion pursuant to s.11(3) of the Immigration Regulations\, SOR/78-72 (""Regulations""). The application for judicial review before this Court is in relation to the H  &  C decision\, not the decision of visa officer Cyril Joseph. Section 11(3) of the Regulations states that a visa officer may issue an immigrant visa to an immigrant who is not awarded the number of units of assessment required under the Immigration Act. Section 11(3) has no applicability to an H  &  C decision and therefore the applicant's arguments concerning the exercise of positive discretion will not be considered in the current application for judicial review.\n\n [5]                 The solicitor for the applicant argues that one of the cited objectives in s. 3 of the Immigration Act is to facilitate the reunion in Canada of permanent residents with their close relatives from abroad. The Baker v. Canada (M.C.I.)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 decision is cited for the proposition that the interest of the applicant must be treated in a manner which is consistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition. Baker\, supra\, addressed a situation where the interest of children were minimized in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's Guidelines. (Emphasis added). \n\n [6]                 It is useful to reproduce subsection 6(3) of the Immigration Act:\n\n\n\n6(3) Displaced and persecuted- Any Convention refugee and any person who is a member of a class designated by the Governor in Council as a class\, the admission of members of which would be in accordance with Canada's humanitarian tradition with respect to the displaced and the persecuted\, may be granted admission\, subject to such regulations as may be established with respect thereto and to the immigration plan currently in force and notwithstanding any other regulations made under this Act. (Emphasis added)\n6(3) Personnes d_plac_es ou pers_cut_es - Les r_fugi_s au sens de la Convention et les personnes appartenant _ une cat_gorie d_clar_e admissible par le gouverneur en conseil conform_ment _ la tradition humanitaire suivie par le Canada _ l'_gard des personnes d_plac_es ou pers_cut_es peuvent _tre admis\, sous r_serve des r_glements pris _ cette fin et du plan d'immigration et par d_rogation aux r_glements d'application g_n_rale. (Je souligne)\n\n\n\n\n [7]                 A person\, therefore\, may be admitted in accordance with Canada's humanitarian tradition if that person is a member of a designated class and subject also to regulations and the immigration plan currently in force.\n\n [8]                 Prior to 1992 a regulation under the Immigration Act extended eligibility under immigration selection criteria to certain retired persons. The regulation was revoked on June 21\, 1991\, in keeping with the Immigration Plan for 1991-1995. The analysis statement found with the amendment explained that\, to maintain adequate members of younger skilled immigrants in the plan without sacrificing other objectives\, the decision was taken to eliminate the retiree program. The statement further stated that the ""retiree"" class was originally introduced to accommodate those who were born in Canada\, had given up their citizenship and wished to return in later years. In 1989 this was no longer the case when only 4% of the 3500 landed retirees were born in Canada.\n\n [9]                 The Minister's Guidelines and the Immigration Plan are provided for in the Immigration Act. It is to be noted that the applicant is not questioning the Minister's right to regulate access by regulation or implement an immigration plan.\n\n\n\n [10]            In relation to the H  &  C application\, the applicant argues that the Immigration Programme Manager did not adequately weigh the applicant's desire to re-unite with his family and did not give enough weight to the fact that the applicant has significant economic resources. The applicant argues that family reunification would ensure that he is taken care of in his old age and that he is emotionally dependant on his family. These facts\, according to the applicant\, warrant the granting of special relief. The applicant further submits that the Immigration Programme Manager's written reasons were inadequate in that they did not demonstrate that the officer considered that the applicant could successfully establish himself in Canada. The applicant further submits that the Immigration Programme Manager breached the duty of procedural fairness by not giving the applicant an interview. Finally\, the applicant argues that the Immigration Programme Manager based his decision on erroneous considerations such as the applicant's ability to visit his family rather than obtaining permanent residency in Canada.\n\n [11]            The respondent submits that there are no reviewable errors in the Immigration Programme Manager's negative H  &  C decision. The respondent points out that one of the H  &  C factors cited by the applicant is that he is wealthy. The respondent argues that subsection114(2) of the Immigration Act should not be used as a way for wealthy people to retire in Canada\, rather\, the applicant could retire in Canada as an investor pursuant to s. 6.11 of the Regulations. Further\, the respondent submits that the Immigration Programme Manager did consider that most of the applicant's family lives in Canada but did not find that this warranted special relief. Finally\, the respondent submits that there was no breach of procedural fairness since the Immigration Programme Manager was not required to give the applicant an interview.\n\n\n\n [12]            The Supreme Court of Canada in Baker\, supra\, set the standard of review of a Canadian immigration officer's decision in an H  &  C application pursuant to subsection 114(2) of the Immigration Act to be reasonablenesssimpliciter. In determining whether a decision is unreasonable\, the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker\, supra\, stated at page 857:\nI will next examine whether the decision in this case\, and the immigration officer's interpretation of the scope of the discretion conferred upon him\, was unreasonable in the sense contemplated in the judgment of Iacobucci J. in Southam\, supra\, at para. 56:\n\nAn unreasonable decision is one that\, in the main\, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination. Accordingly\, a court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to see whether any reasons support it. The defect\, if there is one\, could presumably be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions are sought to be drawn from it.\n\n [13]            The question is\, therefore\, did the Immigration Programme Manager reasonably consider the applicant's H  &  C application?\n\n [14]            The applicant's first argument is that the Immigration Programme Manager did not adequately consider the fact that most of the applicant's family lives in Canada and that the applicant would suffer emotional hardship if not re-united with his family. This argument\, in my opinion\, is without foundation. The Immigration Programme Manager's refusal letter dated November 8\, 2000\, clearly states that the applicant is close to his family and wishes to be re-united with them (tribunal record\, page 4 ):\nAlthough your client has a close personal relationship with his relatives in Canada and wishes to join them\, I do not think that this is sufficient to invoke the humanitarian compassionate provisions of the Canadian Immigration Act.\n\n [15]            In the Immigration Programme Manager's CAIPS notes he indicates the following concerning the separation of the applicant and his family (tribunal record\, page 93):\n\n\nThe act of immigrating by its very essence involves separation from family friends and customary surroundings. It frequently involves the splitting of families. The applicant's situation in this regard is not unusual. Nor are the hardships disproportionate or the ""misfortunes"" caused by this so serious that they warrant granting of special relief.\n\n [16]            Guideline 9.07 of the Immigration Manual provides guidance for visa officers to determine whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist by stating that such grounds exist if ""unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused to the person seeking consideration if he or she had to leave Canada."" The Immigration Programme Manager in the case at bar considered how close the applicant is to his mother\, sisters and brother\, and considered that the applicant would endure some hardship by leaving Canada. However\, the Immigration Programme Manager also considered the fact that the applicant has significant financial resources and is a permanent resident of the United States with no restriction on visiting Canada. Based on these facts\, I am of the view that the Immigration Programme Manager's conclusion that the applicant would not suffer unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he had to leave Canada is a reasonable conclusion.\n\n [17]            The same analysis is applicable to the Immigration Programme Manager's consideration of the applicant's ability to establish himself economically. According to the applicant\, the Immigration Programme Manager did not adequately consider the applicant's financial wealth and his ability to establish himself in Canada. The Immigration Programme Manager did consider the fact that the applicant is wealthy but did not consider this fact added to the applicant's humanitarian and compassionate plea. As the Immigration Programme Manager explains in his refusal letter (tribunal record\, page 4):\nI fail to see the misfortune that would qualify your client for special relief. He is a comparatively wealthy man with legal status in the United States.\n\n\n\nFurther\, in the Immigration Programme Manager's CAIPS notes\, he states the following (tribunal record\, page 93):\nThe applicant is a permanent resident of the USA. He is comparatively wealthy having fixed assets of over one million dollars.\n\nThe Immigration Programme Manager considered the applicant's financial assets\, but did not find that this fact added to the applicant's H  &  C application. This assessment is reasonable and need not be interfered with.\n\n [18]            Finally\, the applicant argues that he was denied procedural fairness by not having an interview. As the Supreme Court held in Baker\, supra\, at page 842\, an interview is not a general requirement for H  &  C decisions:\nAn interview is not essential for the information relevant to an H  &  C application to be put before an immigration officer\, so that the humanitarian and compassionate considerations presented may be considered in their entirety and in a fair manner. In this case\, the appellant had the opportunity to put forward\, in written form through her lawyer\, information about her situation\, her children and their emotional dependence on her...\n\nSimilarly\, the applicant\, in the case at bar\, submitted written arguments explaining the applicant's humanitarian and compassionate grounds which were fully considered by the Immigration Programme Manager. In my opinion\, there was no breach of procedural fairness by not giving the applicant an interview.\n\n [19]            For the foregoing reasons\, the application for judicial review will be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n [20]            The parties\, having had the opportunity\, have not requested that I certify a serious question of general importance as contemplated by section 83 of the Immigration Act. Therefore\, I do not propose to certify a serious question of general importance.\n\n                                                                             ORDER\n\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that:\n\n1.        The application for judicial review is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                   ""Edmond P.

Introduction\n[1]              \nThe\nImmigration Officer considered the Applicant__s allegation that the refusal of\nher work permit application was unfair in that she was misled by the fact that\nthe Quebec authorities had\ndifferent criteria than those set out in s. 112 of the Immigration and\nRefugee Protection Regulations\, SOR/2002/227 (Regulations) with respect to\nlive-in caregivers.\n \n[2]              \nThe\nImmigration Officer noted that it is clearly stated on the __certificate\nd__acceptation du Qu_bec _ titre de travailleur temporaire__ (CAQ) that __Le\npr_sent certificat n__est pas un document d__admission et ne saurait en aucun cas\ndispenser son titulaire des autorisations requises par le Gouvernement du\nCanada__.\n \nII.  Judicial Procedure\n[3]              \nThis\nis an application for judicial review of a decision of an Immigration Officer\,\ndated November 4\, 2008\, denying the Applicant__s application to file an\nApplication for Permanent Residence from within Canada on\nhumanitarian and compassionate grounds.\n \nIII.  Facts\n[4]              \nThe\nApplicant\, Ms. Cheryl-Ann Arlette Lynch (a.k.a. Arlette Lynch)\, is a citizen of\nSt-Vincent and the Grenadines. She came to Canada\, as a\nvisitor\, on April 15\, 2003. She was entitled to stay in Canada until\nOctober 14\, 2003.\n \n[5]              \nMs.\nLynch was allowed to extend her visitor status a few times\, up until December\n31\, 2006. Every time her visitor status was extended\, Ms. Lynch was reminded\nthat she was prohibited from engaging in employment in Canada.\n \n[6]              \nMs.\nLynch was issued a CAQ\, in April 2004\, March 2005 and February 2006. The letter\nsent to Ms. Lynch along with the certificates stated: __Nous vous signalons que\nnotre Certificat d__acception du Qu_bec (CAQ) ne vous autorise pas _ travailler\ntant que vous n__aurez pas obtenu un permis de travail de Citoyennet_ et Immigration\nCanada__.\n \n[7]              \nOn\nJuly 9\, 2004\, Ms. Lynch__s application for a work permit filed from within Canada was refused in\nVegreville because she was ineligible.\n \n[8]              \nOn\nJune 5\, 2006\, Ms. Lynch__s application for a work permit as a live-in-caregiver\nwas refused at the visa office of Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago as she did not meet the\nrequirements of section 112 of the Regulations. More specifically\, the\ndesignated immigration officer concluded that Ms. Lynch had not successfully\ncompleted a course of study equivalent to secondary schooling in Canada and\nthat she did not have one year of full-time work experience within the three\nyears prior to the day she submitted her application for a work permit.\n \n[9]              \nMs.\nLynch did not file an Application for Leave and for Judicial Review of the\ndecision refusing her work permit. Instead\, she continued to work illegally.\n \n[10]          \nOn\nJanuary 31\, 2007\, Ms. Lynch__s Application for an extension of her visitor\nrecord was refused.\n \n[11]          \nOn\nMarch 27\, 2007\, Ms. Lynch__s Application for a temporary resident permit and a\nwork permit was refused.\n \n[12]          \nOn\nNovember 13\, 2007\, Ms. Lynch submitted her Application for Permanent Residence\nfrom within Canada based on H&C\nconsiderations.\n \nIV.  Analysis\n[13]          \nMs.\nLynch filed as Exhibit __B__ of her affidavit __A copy of relevant portions of the\nM.I.C.C. website and its Guide des proc_dures d__immigration regarding\nthe requirements of the live-in caregiver program.\n \n[14]          \nThese\ndocuments should not be considered as they were not submitted to the Immigration\nOfficer who rendered the decision which is under review (Asafov v.

New Brunswick\, 2008 SCC 9\, [2008]\nS.C.R. 190; Doroshenko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 1139\, [2008]\nF.C.J. No. 1422 (QL)).\n \nGeneral Principles\n[18]          \nIt\nis a fundamental principle of the IRPA that those who want to become permanent\nresident of Canada must apply for permanent residence from outside Canada (IRPA at s. 11;\nRegulations at s. 6; Espino v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, 2007 FC 74\, 308 F.T.R. 92; Singh v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 11\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 4 (QL)).\n \n[19]          \nSection\n25 of the IRPA gives the Minister the power to allow individuals to file their\napplication for permanent residence from within Canada. This is an exceptional and discretionary\nmeasure (Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2002 FCA 125\, [2002] 4\nF.C. 358 (C.A.) at paras. 15-16).\n \n[20]          \nThe\ntest to be applied by an immigration officer when reaching a decision under\nsection 25 of the IRPA is to determine whether the person who requests an\nexception would suffer unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if he\nwere to follow the normal requirements of the Act. In Irimie v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration) (2000)\, 10 Imm. L.R. (3d) 206\, [2000] F.C.J.\nNo. 1906 (QL)\, it is stated:\n[26]      I return to my observation that the evidence suggests that the\napplicants would be a welcome addition to the Canadian community. Unfortunately\,\nthat is not the test. To make it the test is to make the H & C process an\nex post facto screening device which supplants the screening process contained\nin the Immigration Act and Regulations. This would encourage gambling on\nrefugee claims in the belief that if someone can stay in Canada long enough to\ndemonstrate that they are the kind of persons Canada wants\, they will be\nallowed to stay. The H & C process is not designed to eliminate hardship;\nit is designed to provide relief from unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate\nhardship. There is no doubt that the refusal of the applicants' H & C\napplication will cause hardship but\, given the circumstances of the applicants'\npresence in Canada and the state of the record\,\nit is not unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship__\n \n[21]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer applied the right test and her assessment of the evidence\nwas reasonable.\n \nThe Immigration\nOfficer__s decision was reasonable\n[22]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer__s decision was reasonable. She dealt with all the grounds\nraised by Ms. Lynch in support of her H&C request. The fact that she did\nnot arrive at the conclusion that Ms. Lynch wanted does not mean that she did\nnot consider her allegations.\n \nThe __misleading__\ninformation\n[23]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer considered Ms. Lynch__s allegation that the refusal of her\nwork permit application was unfair in that she was misled by the fact that the Quebec authorities had\ndifferent criteria than those set out in s. 112 of the Regulations with respect\nto live-in caregivers.\n \n[24]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer noted that it is clearly stated on the CAQ that __Le\npr_sent certificat n__est pas un document d__admission et ne saurait en aucun cas\ndispenser son titulaire des autorisations requises par le Gouvernement du\nCanada__.\n \n[25]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer concluded that Ms. Lynch failed to explain why it would be\nunusual\, undeserved or disproportionate to file an application for permanent\nresidence from Outside Canada.\n \n[26]          \nMs.\nLynch shows her disagreement with the decision rendered by the Immigration\nOfficer. She reiterates that the information provided by the Quebec authorities\nwas misleading\, that she and her employer reasonably followed the instructions\nthey received for three years\, that being misinformed by a competent government\nagency is an unusual and undeserved hardship when that conduct causes a person\nto invest years of their life and their funds in pursuing a course of action\nthat is doomed to failure.\n \n[27]          \nNote\nof Ms. Lynch__s arguments show that the Immigration Officer committed an error\nwhich would warrant this Court__s intervention.\n \n[28]          \nMs.\nLynch__s arguments divert the Court from the real issue that the Immigration\nOfficer had to look at.\n \n[29]          \nThe\nissue was not whether being misinformed by the Quebec authorities constituted unusual and\nundeserved hardship. Rather\, the issue was whether the requirement to apply for\npermanent residence from outside Canada would cause Ms. Lynch unusual\, undeserved or\ndisproportionate hardship.\n \n[30]          \nIn\nany event\, assuming that Ms. Lynch and her employer were misled by the Quebec authorities\, and were\nnot simply willfully blind\, this is a matter between them and the province and\ndoes not confer Ms. Lynch the right to have her Application for Permanent\nResidence processed from within Canada.\n \n[31]          \nMs.\nLynch and her employer might possibly have legal recourses against the province\nfor their losses; however\, the Quebec authorities warned Ms. Lynch and her employer that a work\npermit had to be obtained from CIC. This should have incited them to look at\nthe federal requirements.\n \n[32]          \nHad\nMs. Lynch and her employer been more interested in the federal requirements\,\nthey would have easily found the requirements of s. 112 of the Regulations.\nThey would also have found that the operation manuals located on CIC__s website\nhave two chapters on live-in caregivers (Chapter OP 14 deals with the\nprocessing of the initial application for a work permit in the live-in\ncaregiver category and Chapter IP 4 describes the processing of the subsequent\nrenewal and issuance of new work permits and the application for permanent\nresidence in Canada following the completion of two years of employment as a\nlive-in caregiver). Chapter OP 14 clearly states:\n\n\n\n\n8.6 Quebec-bound applicants\n \n \nUnder\n  the Canada-Quebec Accord\, Quebec's consent is required in order to\n  admit live-in caregivers as\n  temporary workers. Therefore a Certificat d'acceptation du Qu_bec (CAQ) is\n  required before issuing a\n  work permit. The Minist_re des Relations avec les citoyens et de\n  l'Immigration (MRCI) issues\n  a CAQ only after both the employer and employee have signed the live-in\n  caregiver work contract.\n \n \n \nWhen an applicant has obtained a CAQ but does not meet\n  federal requirements\, the federal Regulations take precedence. These applicants should be\n  refused. Issuance of a CAQ under the federal Live-in Caregiver Program does not automatically\n  guarantee a work permit.\n  (Emphasis added).\n \n\n\n8.6 Requ_rants qui entendent se rendre au Qu_bec\n \nAux\n  termes de l'Accord Canada-Qu_bec\, le Qu_bec doit donner son\n  consentement en\n  vue de l'admission d'aides familiaux r_sidants en qualit_ de\n  travailleurs temporaires. Il faut donc obtenir un Certificat d'acceptation du\n  Qu_bec (CAQ) avant\n  de d_livrer un permis de travail. Le Minist_re des Relations avec les citoyens\n  et de l'Immigration (MRCI) exige\, avant de d_livrer un tel certificat\, que l'employeur\n  et l'employ_ signent un contrat de travail d'aide familial r_sidant. \n \nSi un requ_rant obtient un CAQ\, mais ne\n  satisfait pas aux exigences du gouvernement f_d_ral\, ce sont\n  les dispositions r_glementaires f_d_rales qui priment. Il faut refuser les\n  demandes de ces requ_rants. La d_livrance\n  d'un CAQ aux termes du Programme des aides familiaux r_sidants du gouvernement\n  f_d_ral ne garantit pas automatiquement la d_livrance d'un permis de travail.\n \n\n\n\n\n \n[33]          \nMs.\nLynch was never misled by the Canadian authorities\, but even if it were the\ncase\, it would not give her the right to have her Application for Permanent\nResidence processed from within Canada.\n \n[34]          \nWith\nrespect to Ms. Lynch__s allegation that she and her employer reasonably followed\nthe instructions they received for three years is inaccurate. Both Ms. Lynch\nand her employer were informed that a work permit was required and they\ndisregarded this requirement.\n \nThe allegation of\ndomestic violence\n[35]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer also considered Ms. Lynch__s allegation that she had been\nabused in the past by her former boyfriend. In two paragraphs of her\nsubmissions in support of her Application for Permanent Residence from within Canada\, Ms. Lynch stated that\nshe had a relationship with a man who was violent. She wrote that this\nrelationship came to an end in 2002.\n \n[36]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer found that Ms. Lynch did not explain how this situation\nwould prevent her from filing her Application for Permanent Residence from\noutside Canada.\n \n[37]          \nIn\nlight of Ms. Lynch__s own admission that she had left her violent boyfriend in\n2002 and in the absence of any allegation that she would still be at risk\, the\nImmigration Officer__s decision was reasonable.\n \n[38]          \nThe\nsame can be said with respect to Ms. Lynch__s allegations that her baby died the\nday after she gave birth. Moreover\, as was noted by the Immigration Officer\,\nMs. Lynch did not provide any document to prove her allegations.\n \n[39]          \nIt\nis clear from the jurisprudence that Ms. Lynch had the onus of establishing the\nfacts on which her request for an exemption was based (Owusu v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FCA 38\, [2004] 2 F.C.R. 635\nat para. 8; Williams v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2006 FC 1474\, 154 A.C.W.S. (3d) 689; Doroshenko\, above; Samaroo v.\nCanada\, 2007 FC 292\, 156 A.C.W.S. (3d) 440; Li v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 1292\, 152 A.C.W.S. (3d) 699; Wazid\,\nabove).\n \nThe\nimpact of the Applicant__s departure on her employer and her employer__s\nchildren\, the Applicant__s attachment with her relatives in Canada\, the impact\nof the Applicant__s departure on her family members in St-Vincent and the\nApplicant__s social and economic establishment in Canada\n \n[40]          \nAt\nparagraph 27 of her memorandum\, Ms. Lynch argues that the Immigration Officer\nminimized the hardships that she would encounter if she had to apply outside of\nCanada.\n \n[41]          \nMs.\nLynch invites the Court to substitute its own assessment of the evidence to\nthat of the Immigration Officer and come to a different conclusion. That is not\nthe role of the Court on judicial review (Li v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 1292\, 152 A.C.W.S. (3d) 699 at para.\n25; Choudhary v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 412\, 166 A.C.W.S.\n(3d) 1124 at para. 23; Samaroo\, above at para. 17; Williams\,\nabove at para. 12).\n \n[42]          \nA\nreading of the Immigration Officer__s notes shows that she considered all the\ngrounds submitted by Ms. Lynch in support of her Application for Permanent\nResidence from within Canada. She did not ignore the\nimpact that a departure from Canada would have on the Ms. Lynch and on other people; however\,\nshe found that this did not constitute unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate\nhardship.\n \n[43]          \nAccording\nto the jurisprudence\, the degree of establishment in Canada is not decisive on an\napplication based on H&C considerations. Similarly\, the hardship inherent\nin being required to leave after having spent several years in Canada is normally not\nsufficient to warrant an exception. Again\, s. 25 of the IRPA is intended to\nprovide an exceptional relief for unusual\, undeserved and disproportionate\nhardship (Singh\, above at paras. 51-52; Wazid\, above at paras.\n14-16; Monteiro v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2006 FC 1322\, 166 A.C.W.S. (3d) 556 at paras. 18-20; Lee v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 368\, 167 A.C.W.S.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2007 FC 66\, 308 F.T.R. 111 at paras. 9-10 and 36-40).\n \n[44]          \nAs\nwas stated by Justice James Russell\, in Pashulya v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FC 1275\, 275 F.T.R. 143:\n[43]      An\napplicant has a high threshold to meet when requesting an exemption from the\napplication of s. 11(1) of IRPA. This Court has repeatedly held that the\nH & C process is designed not to eliminate the hardship inherent in being\nasked to leave after one has been in place for a period of time\, but to provide\nrelief from ""unusual\, undeserved and disproportionate hardship"" caused\nif an applicant is required to leave Canada and apply from abroad in the normal\nfashion. That the Applicant must sell a house or car or leave a job or family\nis not necessarily undue or disproportionate hardship; rather it is a\nconsequence of the risk the Applicant took by staying in Canada without landing\n(Irimie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000)\, 10\nImm. LR. (3d) 206 at paras. 12\, 17\, 26 (F.C.T.D.); Mayburov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration) (2000)\, 183\nF.T.R. 280 at para. 7; Lee v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, 2001 FCT 7\nat para. 14).\n \n[45]          \nMs.\nLynch chose to work illegally in Canada. Accordingly\, the Immigration Officer was\nentitled to conclude that her employment and the attachment with her employer__s\nchildren were not independent from her control. As was stated by Justice Marc\nNadon\, in Tartchinska v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000)\, 185 F.T.R. 161\,\n96 A.C.W.S. (3d) 112:\n[21]      More importantly\, the Guidelines\ncertainly do not suggest that an applicant must pursue self-sufficiency at all\ncost and without regard to the means. I therefore disagree with the\nApplicants"" argument that ""[i]t is irrelevant whether\nself-sufficiency is pursued with or without a work permit."" In my opinion\,\nthe source of one""s self-sufficiency is very relevant; otherwise\, anyone\ncould claim an exemption on the basis of self-sufficiency even if that\nself-sufficiency derived from illegal activities. I appreciate that in this\ncase the Applicants worked honestly\, albeit illegally. Nonetheless\, the\nApplicants knowingly attempted to circumvent the system when they chose to\ncontinue working without authorization. Indeed\, despite being told during\ntheir first interview that they were not authorized to work and that they should\ncease\, there was no indication that the Applicants had given up their\nemployment at the time of the second interview. Moreover\, their lawyer had\ncautioned them about the risks of working without a work permit as well as on\nthe ostensible benefit of showing self-sufficiency (regardless of its source)\,\nand they chose to remain in Canada and work illegally.\n \n[22]      I understand that the Applicants hoped\nthat accumulating time in Canada despite a departure order against them might\nbe looked on favourably insofar as they could demonstrate that they have\nadapted well to this country. In my view\, however\, applicants cannot and\nshould not be ""rewarded"" for accumulating time in Canada\,\nwhen in fact\, they have no legal right to do so. In a similar vein\,\nself-sufficiency should be pursued legally\, and an applicant should not be able\nto invoke his or her illegal actions to subsequently claim a benefit such as a\nMinisterial exemption. Finally\, I take note of the obvious: the purpose of\nthe exemption\, in this case\, was to exempt the Applicants from the requirement\nof applying for status from abroad\, not to exempt them from other statutory\nprovisions such as the requirement of a valid work permit.

In the letter\, the Immigration Officer declined to issue a Returning Resident's Permit (RRP) to the applicant\, because he was not working for a Canadian company abroad. On April 22\, 1996\, the Officer confirmed that the application was denied since working for a non-Canadian company was not a ground upon which a RRP is normally granted. The principle issue raised by the applicant is whether the Immigration Officer fettered her discretion in refusing to issue the RRP.\n      The applicant\, a citizen of Lebanon but born in Kuwait\, arrived in Canada in 1990\, made a refugee claim which was accepted in 1991\, and in June 1992 obtained permanent residency status. The applicant subsequently travelled to Lebanon\, married\, and upon returning to Canada took training in AutoCAD design. He immediately obtained employment but was laid off seven months later. After being laid off\, he was unable to find permanent employment.\n      In 1993\, the applicant travelled to seek employment in Kuwait\, where he had previously worked because\, although he did not want to work there\, he did not want to be dependent upon social assistance in Canada. Upon returning to Canada\, and being still unable to find a job\, he returned to Kuwait late in 1993 where in January 1994\, by using his contacts\, he was able to secure employment with Ali Al-Quraishi Trading Co.\n      In May 1994\, the applicant returned to Canada in order to accompany his wife whom he sponsored. At the end of May\, both the applicant and his wife returned to Kuwait. He returned to Canada in September 1994\, leaving again in October 1994. His most recent return was on November 28\, 1995. Upon his return\, he was admitted as a permanent resident after satisfying the Immigration Officer that he had not abandoned Canada as his place of permanent residence. The applicant was advised by the Immigration Officer that he should apply for a Returning Resident's Permit (RRP) pursuant to s.24 of the Immigration Act.\n      The applicant's intention was to keep his employment in Kuwait for two additional years\, after which time he would return to Canada since he has no permanent status in Kuwait and is not permitted to own property there.\n      On his last visit to Canada\, he purchased a condominium. He has a mortgage on his home\, a valid driver's licence and has paid his taxes. He hopes that by working in Kuwait until December 1997\, he will be able to save enough money to support his family.\n      \n      After applying for a RRP\, Mr. El Amin was sent the following letter which cites the decision reached:\n\n \n          \nImmigration Canada\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n975 Alloy Drive\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nThunder Bay\, Ontario\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nP7B 6N5\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n18 April 1996\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nMr. Ali Ahmad El-Amin\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n2900 Windjammer Road\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nMississauga\, Ontario\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nL5L 1S7\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nThis refers to your applications (sic) for a returning resident permit.\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nYour application was reviewed by a senior immigration officer and your request was refused.

The discretion is very broad and allows an Immigration Officer to grant a RRP for reasons or circumstances other than those listed in the Regulations. Since the Officer did not assess the applicant under this discretionary section\, the applicant argues that she breached the principles of procedural fairness by following inflexible standards.\n      Section 25 of the Immigration Act provides as follows:\n\n \n          \n25(1) Applications for returning resident permits\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nWhere a permanent resident intends to leave Canada for any period of time or is outside Canada\, that person may in prescribed manner make an application to an immigration officer for a returning resident permit.\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n25(2) Proof of intention\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \nPossession by a person of a valid returning resident permit issued to that person pursuant to the regulations is\, in the absence of evidence to the contrary\, proof that the person did not leave or remain outside Canada with the intention of abandoning Canada as his place of permanent residence.\n          \n\n \n      Section 26 of the Immigration Regulations provides:\n\n \n          \n26. (1) When a permanent resident intends to leave Canada for any period of time or is outside Canada\, he may make an application\, orally or in writing\, to an immigration officer for a returning resident permit.\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n(2) Subject to subsection (3)\, an immigration officer shall issue a returning resident permit to a permanent resident who has made an application therefor where the permanent resident\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n      (a) has provided the immigration officer with two clearly identifiable photographs of himself;\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          \n      (b) has appeared for an interview if requested by the immigration officer; and\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          \n      (c) intends to leave or left Canada\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          \n          (i) for the purpose of carrying out his duties as a representative or employee of a corporation or business organization established in Canada or as a representative or employee of the Government of Canada or of a province or a municipality in Canada\,\n                          \n\n \n\n \n          \n          (ii) for the purpose of upgrading his professional\, academic or vocational qualifications\,\n                          \n\n \n\n \n          \n          (iii) for the purpose of accompanying a member of his family who is a Canadian citizen or has been issued a returning resident permit\, or\n                          \n\n \n\n \n          \n           (iv) in any circumstances not referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iii) that the immigration officer deems appropriate. [Emphasis added]\n                          \n\n \n\n \n          \n(3) An immigration officer shall not issue a returning resident permit where the immigration officer and a senior immigration officer believe on reasonable grounds that the person applying therefor has ceased or will cease to be a permanent resident under subsection 24(1) of the Act.\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n(4) An immigration officer may\, pursuant to subsection (2)\, issue a returning resident permit\n          \n\n \n\n \n          \n      (a) valid for a period not exceeding 12 months; or\n                  \n\n \n\n \n          \n      (b) with the approval of a senior immigration officer\, valid for a period not exceeding 24 months.\n                  \n\n \n      The respondent argues that there is no right to a RRP\, each case is determined on a case-by-case basis\, and a decision pursuant to the Regulations is discretionary. Being discretionary\, the respondent states that the Court should not interfere with the Immigration Officer's decision unless it can be established that an error was committed.\n      Even though an affidavit was supplied in this motion by the Immigration Officer\, which elaborates on the investigation she undertook\, I find that the reason for the decision she made is that expressed on the face of the letter above quoted. It is apparent from the decision enunciated in the letter that the Immigration Officer did not exercise her discretion when determining whether to grant the applicant a RRP since she required the applicant to meet the sole criterion set out in s.26(2)(c)(i). Therefore\, I find that she fettered her discretion in error.\n      Accordingly\, I allow this application for judicial review\, set aside the decision\, and refer the matter back to another Immigration officer for redetermination.\n                           Douglas R.

In March 2000\, the Applicant submitted an application for a student authorization in order to attend Malaspina University College in British Columbia where he was accepted into a one-year English as a second language program and was conditionally accepted into a Bachelor of Computer Science Program for a period of approximately four years.\n[3]      At the time the application was being processed\, he was studying English Language at Rochester Independent College in the United Kingdom on a student visa which has since expired.\n[4]      On April 5\, 2000\, the Immigration Officer reviewed the application and the supporting material submitted and found that the Applicant had no previous travel history. He was a recent arrival to the United Kingdom and his status in the UK was temporary. The Immigration Officer also concluded that the only tie the Applicant had established in his home country was the fact that his parents reside in China and that the Applicant had not provided adequate information on the situation in his home country. According to the Immigration Officer\, she was unable to establish the validity or authenticity of the documentation provided by the Applicant.\n[5]      The Immigration Officer found that documentation revealed that the Applicant had been accepted as a full-time student in an English second language program at Malaspina University College in Nanaimo\, B.C. along with a conditional acceptance into a Bachelor of Science-Computer Science Program to last from April 25\, 2000 until April 30\, 2004. However\, the acceptance letter indicated that the program completion may take longer depending on the level of the Applicant's English skills\, progress in learning English\, and possessing or achieving the necessary academic program prerequisites. Fees for the first semester totalling $3\,551.68 were paid in advance.\n[6]      The Applicant did not include a personal letter or study plan offering an explanation as to his intentions. However\, a financial guarantee was submitted by the Applicant's mother indicating that the Applicant would abide by all school regulations and return to China upon the completion of his study.\n[7]      On April 27\, 2000\, the Immigration Officer refused the Applicant's application for a student authorization on the grounds that she was not satisfied that the Applicant was not an intending Immigrant. In the refusal letter\, the Immigration Officer stated that the Applicant did not have any previous travel history as he had just arrived in the UK. She also stated that she did not have the ability to establish the Applicant's ties to his home country\, or the authenticity of the documentation provided and that she was not satisfied that he was abono fide visitor to Canada.\n[8]      The question I must determine is whether the Immigration Officer erred in her assessment of the evidence with regards to the Applicant's family ties in China and his intention to return to China.\n[9]      The Applicant submits that the Immigration Officer erred in her interpretation of section 9(1.2) of the Immigration Act as meaning that an application for temporary entry into Canada can be refused if the immigration officer is not satisfied that the applicant does not intend to immigrate to Canada. Section 9(1.2) does not entail that an intention to immigrate to Canada is a valid reason for refusing an application for a temporary visa\, but rather that an intention to remain in Canada illegally\, after the expiration of a temporary visa\, may be considered as a reason to refuse the application. The Immigration Officer needs only to consider if whether or not the Applicant has a valid temporary purpose in seeking to travel to Canada.\n[10]      The Applicant further submits that the Immigration Officer based her decision on a number of findings that were erroneous and / or irrelevant:\n\n \n      a) The Immigration Officer stated that the Applicant has no history of travel. Rather\, the Applicant does have a history of travel as he applied and obtained a visitor student visa for the UK. The Applicant at the time of the application was only 17 years of age;\n\n \n\n \n      b) The Immigration Officer raised concerns about why the Applicant has not applied for computer courses in the UK which is entirely irrelevant;\n\n \n\n \n      c) The Immigration Officer ignored the fact or gave inappropriate weight to the fact that the Applicant had already been studying for 8 months in the UK;\n\n \n\n \n      d) The Immigration Officer ignored the evidence in regards to the Applicant's family situation and job offer in China on the grounds that she was unable to ""establish the ... authenticity of documentation provided"". The Applicant argues that the Immigration Officer breached procedural fairness in not making any attempt to check the authenticity of these documents.\n\n \n [11]      The Applicant submits that the Immigration Officer erred in failing to bring concerns to her attention and to provide an opportunity to disabuse her of those concerns.\n[12]      The Respondent submits that the appropriate standard of review for an immigration officer's decision not to issue a student authorization is patent unreasonableness.\n[13]      The Respondent argues that an immigration officer is entitled to consider a variety of factors when assessing an applicant's long term goals and visitor visa application\, including level of education and his pattern of employment. Furthermore\, the requirements for obtaining a visitor's visa are clearly set out in the Act and the Regulations. Pursuant to subsection 2(1) of the Act and 13(2) of theRegulations a person applying for a visitor's visa must have a temporary purpose.\n[14]      The Respondent submits summarily that based on the evidence before her\, the Immigration Officer concluded that the Applicant was not a genuine visitor to Canada and therefore did not meet the requirements of theAct and therefore was rightly refused.\n[15]      The Respondent further submits that given the absence of a personal letter or study plan\, as well as the other circumstances surrounding the application\, as noted in CAIPS and in her affidavit\, the Immigration Officer was not satisfied that the Applicant would return upon the completion of his studies in Canada.\n[16]      The Respondent contends that there is no ground for arguing unfairness in the process merely because the Immigration Officer did not communicate all of her concerns to the Applicant or give her an opportunity to respond as the issue of intention to reside in Canada is a matter that arises directly from the Act and the Regulations and are available to applicants whose task is to establish to the satisfaction of the visa officer that they meet the criteria set out\, and that their admission to Canada would not be contrary to the Act.\n[17]      The Respondent further contends that whether to permit personal as opposed to written representations is a matter within the discretion of the decision-maker. In the case at bar\, the Applicant had a meaningful opportunity to state his reasons for coming to Canada and to put forward all of the information necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Act and the Regulations regarding student authorizations and it was fully and fairly considered.\n[18]      The Applicant seeks an order for a writ of certiorari setting aside the decision and a writ of mandamus directing the Respondent to process the Applicant's application in a favourable manner or referring the matter back to a different immigration officer for reconsideration and costs.\n[19]      In To v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1996] F.C.J. No. 696 (unedited)\, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the appropriate standard of review of the discretionary decisions of visa officers with respect to immigrant applications was the same as that enunciated in Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v.Canada\, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2\, where MacIntyre\, J.\, stated the following:\n\n \n      It is\, as well\, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and\, were required\, in accordance with the principles of natural justice\, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose\, the courts should not interfere.\n\n \n [20]      This has been confirmed by this Court in Tajammul v.Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] F.C.J. No. 259. In light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Baker v.Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 R.C.S. 817\, it would seem that the appropriate standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter.\n[21]      Upon reviewing the evidence\, the Applicant has successfully shown a basis for interfering with the decision as\, in my opinion\, the Immigration Officer did not take into consideration all of the relevant material that was before her.\n[22]      As was stated in the refusal letter sent by the Immigration Officer on April 27\, 2000 and in her Affidavit\, the Immigration Officer refused the application on the basis that she could not establish the Applicant's ties to his home country\, the authenticity of the documentation provided and because she was not satisfied that the Applicant was a bono fide visitor to Canada. According to the Immigration Officer\, the only tie the Applicant had established in his home country was that fact that his parents resided in China.\n[23]      I am satisfied that the Immigration Officer's conclusions are not founded on the evidence and are entirely unreasonable. It is clear from a review of the Certified Tribunal Record\, that the Applicant had a conditional agreement for employment with Hainan Qixing Decoration Engineering Co. Ltd. in Haikou City\, Hainan Province\, China\, upon successful completion of his studies. The Record also contains a letter from Rudi Schepers\, Canadian Overseas Immigration and Business Services Inc.\, in which he makes reference to the Applicant's intention to return to China to take care of his parents and to start his professional career at Hainan Qixing Decoration Engineering Co. Ltd. The Financial Guarantee provided by the Applicant's mother\, Wu Yueying\, also makes reference to his future employment in China.\n[24]      From my reading of the Record\, the Immigration Officer's Affidavit and the Written Submissions of the Respondent\, it appears that the Immigration Officer disregarded the offer of employment which was properly before her. Or\, at the very least\, there is simply no way of knowing whether the officer had due regard for that evidence in reaching its decision.\n[25]      In addition\, several of the Immigration Officer's findings contained in the CAIPS notes are irrelevant. In particular\, why the Applicant\, having just arrived in the United Kingdom from China and wanting to study in Canada\, did not apply from China and whether or not the Applicant had applied to study in a similar program in the United Kingdom is highly irrelevant and should not have been a factor in the assessment. The same can be said of the Applicant's lack of previous travel history. The Applicant is seventeen years of age. It is only logical that his travel history would be limited given his age.\n[26]      The Immigration Officer also stated in the CAIPS notes and in the refusal letter that she could not establish the validity or the authenticity of the documentation the Applicant provided. However\, she fails to provide any evidence to support such a negative determination. This finding is\, in part\, the basis for the Immigration Officer's decision to refuse the application. As such\, she should have enunciated her reasons for questioning the authenticity of the documents. In reviewing these documents\, I can find no obvious reason to question their validity or authenticity.\n[27]      Finally\, paragraph 8 of the Immigration Officer's Affidavit reads that there was no additional documentation that she could request from the Applicant and that she did not believe an interview or request for further documentation would alter the areas of concern. This statement\, in my mind\, makes it clear that the Immigration Officer had already reached a decision and was not open to properly addressing the areas of concerns.\n[28]      It is trite law\, that tribunal reasons are not to be read hypercritically by a court nor are tribunals required to refer to every piece of evidence that is contrary to its findings. However\, I am of the view that the offer of employment from Hainan Qixing Decoration Engineering Co. Ltd.\, despite the fact that it employed both the Applicant's parents and that the Applicant's father owned 40% of the companies shares\, warranted the Immigration Officer's specific consideration and mention in her reasons given the relevance of this information which tended to rebut the presumption that the Applicant is an immigrant pursuant to subsection 8(2) of the Act.\n[29]      As such\, I am of the view that the Immigration Officer was obligated to state why she did not accept the offer of employment in order to establish the Applicant's ties to China and his intention to return upon expiry of a visa and in failing to do so committed a reviewable error.\n[30]      The application for judicial review is granted.\n                                       JUDGE\nOTTAWA\, Ontario\nJanuary 25\, 2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n You are being directed to the most recent version of the statute which may not be the version considered at the time of the judgment.\n\n\nContinue \n\n\n\nDo not display this message anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",immigrationFederal Court Decisions,Adams v.

She has been living in Canada ever since.\n \n[3]              \nIn April\nof 2005\, she submitted an application for permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and\ncompassionate grounds which was updated and supplemented in January of 2008. In\nher updated application\, the Applicant stated she had no familial links in St. Vincent. She has had no contact with\nher mother in St. Vincent. Further\, an elderly friend whom the Applicant was\npreviously living with in St.\n Vincent has since\npassed away. She claimed that the only family she has is her sister Alisha and\nher two nephews living in Canada with her. She also claimed\nstrong support from her cousin also living in Canada. Finally she claimed a close\nrelationship with the children of the family where she works as a nanny-housekeeper.\nShe also carried out some volunteer work for the Salvation Army and she is a\nmember of a local church.\n \nThe Decision\n \n[4]              \nIn the\nMarch 3\, 2009 decision rejecting the application\, the Immigration Officer\, in\nstating the facts\, noted that the Applicant had referred to another pending\napplication on humanitarian and compassionate grounds submitted by her sister\,\nand added that a __further query indicates that applicant__s sister is in Canada\nwithout status and currently under a removal order__.\n \n[5]              \nThe\nImmigration Officer further noted that there was insufficient evidence to\nindicate that the Applicant could not maintain a relationship with her family\nin Canada if she were to return to St. Vincent and concluded that the hardships\nthat would inevitably arise due to separation from family and friends in Canada would not be unusual and\nundeserved or disproportionate hardship.\n \n[6]              \nThe\nImmigration Officer considered the best interests of the Applicant__s two\nCanadian born nephews. Though he recognized that a close relationship can be\nformed between individuals who reside in the same household\, he noted that\nthere was insufficient evidence to show the level of dependency the nephews\nhave with the Applicant or her involvement in their daily lives. He concluded\nthat there was insufficient evidence to suggest that any hardship would be\nencountered by the Applicant or her nephews if she was required to leave Canada.\n \n[7]              \nFinally\,\nthe Immigration Officer considered the establishment of the Applicant in Canada. He recognized that she had\nindeed established herself here\, but he was of the view that there was\ninsufficient evidence to show that she had reached a level of integration and\nestablishment in Canada such as to warrant a positive\nexemption on humanitarian or compassionate grounds.\n \n \n \nPosition of the parties\n \n[8]              \nThe first\nargument of the Applicant was that the Immigration Officer improperly relied on\nthe negative information he gathered from her sister__s application\,\nspecifically the fact that her sister was under a removal order\, and used this\ninformation in considering the Applicant__s own application on humanitarian and\ncompassionate grounds. It was claimed that this constituted a denial of\nprocedural fairness. The Applicant argued that she should have been notified of\nthe fact that the officer was going to rely on her sister__s application and\nalso given an opportunity to respond to this new information.\n \n[9]              \n The\nApplicant also argued that\, taken overall\, the decision was not reasonable. The\nApplicant specifically argued that it was particularly unreasonable for the\nofficer to state that she had not established herself in Canada in light of the findings that\nshe was stably employed here\, was involved in community organizations\, had\ncarried out some studies here and had a good civil record.\n \n[10]          \nFor his\npart\, the Minister argued that the Applicant bears the onus of satisfying the\ndecision maker that her personal circumstances are such that the hardship of\nhaving to obtain a permanent resident visa from outside Canada would be either unusual or\nundeserved or disproportionate hardship. She did not convince the Immigration\nOfficer. The decision of the Immigration Officer is entitled to deference\, and\nthis Court should not intervene if the officer considered the relevant factors.\n \n[11]          \nThe Minister\nfurther argued that the Immigration Officer had considered the relevant\nfactors\, including the degree of establishment in Canada\, the family ties in Canada and in St. Vincent and the best interests of the\nApplicant__s nephews. It is not thus open for this Court to substitute its own\nopinion to the decision of the Immigration Officer.\n \n[12]          \nConcerning\nthe procedural fairness argument raised by the Applicant\, the Minister noted\nthat it was the Applicant herself who raised the residence of her sister in\nCanada as a factor in her application\, and she had clearly indicated in her\noriginal application that her sister was without immigration status in Canada\nawaiting the results of a pending application on humanitarian and compassionate\ngrounds. It was therefore appropriate for the Immigration Officer to verify\nthis information. There is therefore no issue of extrinsic evidence in this\ncase.\n \nThe legislation\n \n[13]          \nSubsection\n25(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the __Act__) reads as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\n25. (1) The Minister shall\, upon request of\n  a foreign national in Canada who is inadmissible or who does not meet the\n  requirements of this Act\, and may\, on the Minister__s own initiative or on\n  request of a foreign national outside Canada\, examine the circumstances concerning\n  the foreign national and may grant the foreign national permanent resident\n  status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligation of this Act\n  if the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and\n  compassionate considerations relating to them\, taking into account the best\n  interests of a child directly affected\, or by public policy considerations.\n \n\n\n25. (1) Le ministre doit\, sur demande d__un\n_tranger\n  se trouvant au Canada qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas\n  _ la pr_sente loi\, et peut\, de sa propre initiative ou sur demande d__un\n  _tranger se trouvant hors du Canada\, _tudier le cas de cet _tranger et peut\n  lui octroyer le statut de r_sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des\n  crit_res et obligations applicables\, s__il estime que des circonstances\n  d__ordre humanitaire relatives _ l___tranger __ compte tenu de l__int_r_t\n  sup_rieur de l__enfant directement touch_ __ ou l__int_r_t public le justifient.\n\n\n\n\n \nStandard of review\n \n[14]          \nReasonableness\nis the appropriate standard of review for a decision concerning an application\nfor permanent residence from within Canada\non humanitarian and compassionate grounds. As noted by the Federal Court of\nAppeal in Kisana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2009 FCA 189\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 713 at para. 18:\n \nIt is unnecessary to engage in a full\nstandard of review analysis where the appropriate standard of review is already\nsettled by previous jurisprudence (see: Dunsmuir v. New\nBrunswick\, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190\,\n2008 SCC 9\, at para.\n62). The parties agree that the standard of review to be applied to an H&C\ndecision is reasonableness. This standard is supported by both pre- and post-Dunsmuir cases (see: Baker v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817;\nThandal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 489; Gill v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 613\, (2008)\, 73 Imm.L.R. (3d) 1).\n \n \n[15]          \nOn the other hand\,\nboth Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick\, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 and Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa\, [2009] 1 S.C.R 339 at para. 43\, state that procedural fairness issues\n(subject to competent legislative override) are to be determined by a court on\nthe basis of a correctness standard of review. This approach has been applied where\nprocedural fairness issues are raised in proceedings involving applications for\npermanent residence within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate\ngrounds: see\, inter alia\, Buio v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\,\n2007 FC 157\, [2007] F.C.J. No. 205 at para. 16.\n \nAnalysis\n[16]          \nThe Applicant has\nessentially raised two issues\, one of procedural fairness based on alleged\nreliance by the Immigration Officer on the removal order against the\nApplicant__s sister\, the other based on the alleged unreasonableness of the\ndecision taken as a whole.\n \n[17]          \nI will first decide\nthe procedural fairness issue. Counsel for both the Applicant and the Minister\nwere of the view that this issue should be reviewed on a standard of\ncorrectness.\n \n \n \nThe\nprocedural fairness argument\n \n \n[18]          \nIn this case\, the Immigration\nOfficer reviewed the pertinent facts which had been submitted by the Applicant\,\nincluding the fact that the Applicant had stated that her sister was without\nstatus and had also submitted an application for permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and\ncompassionate grounds. The Applicant does not take offence with the fact that the\nImmigration Officer verified these facts\, but rather that he did not notify her\nand give her an opportunity to respond when he discovered that her sister was\nthe subject of a removal order\, a fact she herself was not aware of until she\nread the decision refusing her own application.\n \n[19]          \nThe Applicant fears\nthat the officer proceeded with a review of some or of the entire immigration\nfile of her sister\, and may have based his decision in the Applicant__s case on\ninformation contained in her sister__s file. Since the Immigration Officer did\nnot submit an affidavit stating what information he took into account in the\nsister__s file\, the Applicant has no way of knowing what additional information\nwas reviewed by the officer. At the very least\, the officer took into account\nthe removal order against the sister without informing the Applicant of this\nfact and giving her an opportunity to make representations on this matter.\nThis\, for the Applicant\, constitutes a breach of procedural fairness. The\nApplicant contends that the Court needs to send a strong message to immigration\nofficers that if they are to use information contained in third party files in\nmaking decisions\, they must inform the affected applicants of the facts they\nintend to rely upon in order to allow proper representations to be made on\nthese facts.\n \n[20]          \nTo support this\nposition\, the Applicant relies on three decisions: Batiste v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 1382\, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1751; Batica v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2006 FC 762\, [2006] F.C.J. No. 951; and Level v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety\nand Emergency Preparedness\,\n2008 FC 227\, [2008] F.C. J. No. 297. Though these decisions correctly state the\nlaw concerning the use of extrinsic evidence in administrative decision making\nrelated to immigration\, the facts in these decisions have little bearing on\nthis case. Indeed\, in Batiste\,\nsupra at paras. 12\, 16 and 21\, the extrinsic evidence at issue was said\nto be __most significant__\, and __central__ to the impugned decision. Likewise\, in Batica\nand Level\, the extrinsic evidence at stake was also a key factor in the\ndecisions. As discussed below\, this is not the case here.\n \n[21]          \nIt is trite law that\nthe content of procedural fairness is variable and contextual\, and must be\ndecided in the context of each case (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at para. 21). At the heart of the\nmatter is whether\, considering all the circumstances\, those whose interests\nwere affected had a meaningful opportunity to present their case fully and\nfairly (Baker\, supra at para. 30). Relief in cases involving\nprocedural fairness claims is governed by common law principles\, including the\nwithholding of relief when the procedural error is purely technical and\noccasions no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice (Khosa\, supra\nat para. 43).\n \n[22]          \nThe guiding cases in\nthe matter of the use of extrinsic evidence in administrative decisions related\nto immigration are Muliadi v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\, [1986] 2 F.C. 205 (C.A.) and Haghighi v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] 4 F.C. 407 (C.A). Both of these\ncases found a breach of procedural fairness where meaningful facts essential or\npotentially crucial to the decision had been used to support an administrative\ndecision without providing an opportunity to the affected party to respond to\nor comment upon these facts. Indeed\, in Muliadi\, supra at p. 214\,\nthe concerned facts were __of crucial importance in the visa officer__s\ndecision__\, and likewise in Haghighi\, supra at para. 37\, the risk\nassessment reports at issue were found to be __apt to play a crucial role in the\nfinal decision__.\n \n[23]          \nIn this case\, the\nalleged extrinsic evidence concerns a removal order against the Applicant__s\nsister. The following extracts from the Immigrations Officer__s decision are\nreferred to by the Applicant to make her point:\n \n__Submissions\nindicate that applicant__s sister has a pending application for permanent\nresidence in Canada under humanitarian and compassionate\ngrounds. A further query indicates that applicant__s sister is in Canada without status and currently under a removal order. [__]\nThere is also no guarantee that her sister__s application for permanent\nresidence from within Canada will receive a positive decision.__\n \n[24]          \nThese statements are\nentirely factual and flow from the very terms of the Applicant__s application\nfor consideration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Indeed\, in her\noriginal application in April 2005\, the Applicant noted that she was living\nwith her sister and declared the following in regard to her sister__s status:\n__no status-H&C application in process__ (page 78 of decision record).\nMoreover\, this application was accompanied by a letter from an immigration\nconsultant dated April 4\, 2005 which indicated the following: __Eloise [the\nApplicant] is currently living with her sister Ms. Alisha Adams who has also\nfiled a Humanitarian and Compassionate application and her two nephews born in Canada__ (page 74 of decision record).\n \n[25]          \nConsequently\, the\nfacts that the Applicant__s sister has a pending application for permanent\nresidence in Canada under humanitarian and compassionate grounds\, is without\nstatus in Canada and that there is no guarantee that her\nsister__s application will receive a positive decision are all entirely based on\ninformation provided by or on behalf of the Applicant or flow from such\ninformation. The Immigration Officer verified and updated this information as\nhe is entitled to do. It would have been inappropriate for the Immigration\nOfficer not to verify the facts submitted by the Applicant. This update also\nindicated that the Applicant__s sister was under a removal order. Since the\nApplicant herself referred to her sister__s application\, she had to expect that\nthe immigration authorities would verify the status of that application. I see\nnothing wrong with the Immigration Officer proceeding as he did.\n \n[26]          \nThere is indeed no\nevidence in the file suggesting that the Immigration Officer used the removal\norder against the sister as the basis for the decision to deny the Applicant__s\nown application. In such circumstances\, the reference to this removal order by\nthe Immigration Officer in the decision can only be viewed as a simple\nstatement of fact in updating the information which had been initially relied\nupon by the Applicant herself. Consequently\, no duty of procedural fairness\narises here. \n \n[27]          \nI further reject the\nApplicant__s argument that the Immigration Officer may have used other\ninformation contained in the sister__s application to assess and deny the\nApplicant__s own application. Again\, there is nothing in the decision itself or\nin any of the documents submitted which shows that this was the case. I am\nunwilling to impute irregular motives to the Immigration Officer in the absence\nof evidence to the contrary.\n \n[28]          \nMy decision may have\nbeen different had it been established that the Immigration Officer had relied\non information contained in another immigration file in order to reach the\ndecision in this case without notifying the Applicant. However no evidence was\nsubmitted substantiating such a claim.\n \nThe\nreasonableness of the decision taken as a whole\n \n \n[29]          \nIn the context of an\napplication for\npermanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate\ngrounds\, it has been consistently held that the onus of establishing that the\nexemption is warranted lies with the applicant\, and that an Immigration Officer\nis under no duty to highlight weaknesses in an application and to request\nfurther submissions: Kisana\, supra at para. 45; Thandal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2008 FC 489\, [2008] F.C.J. No. 623 at para. 9.\n \n[30]          \nMoreover\, an\nexemption under subsection 25(1) of the Act is an exceptional and discretionary\nremedy: Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2002 FCA 125\, [2002] F.C.J. No.457 at para. 15; Abdirisaq v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2009 FC 300\, [2009] F.C.J. No.377 at para. 3; Kawtharani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2006 FC 162\, [2006] F.C.J. No. 220 at para. 15; Serda v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\,\n2006 FC 356\, [2006] F.C.J. No. 425 at para. 20.\n \n[31]          \nFinally\, it is\nclearly the responsibility of the Minister or his delegate to assess the\nrelevant factors and to determine the weight to be given to each factor in the\ncircumstances of each case: Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, supra\nat para. 11; Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration\, [2002] 1 S.C.R 3 at para. 34. \n \n[32]          \nIn this case\, the\nImmigration Officer reviewed the familial and personal ties of the Applicant to\nCanada and to St. Vincent\, and based on the\nfacts before him\, he did not find that unusual and undeserved or\ndisproportionate hardships would arise from returning the Applicant to St.\nVincent. He also considered the interests of the Applicant__s nephews and noted\nthat there was insufficient evidence provided to suggest any form of hardship\nshould the Applicant be required to leave Canada. It is useful to note in this respect\nthat neither the Applicant__s sister not her nephews submitted any documentation\nto support these hardship claims. The Immigration Officer also found that there\nwas insufficient evidence to indicate the Applicant would not be able to\nre-establish herself in St.\n Vincent. \n \n[33]          \nFinally\, the\nImmigration Officer found insufficient evidence to show that the Applicant had\nestablished herself in Canada to a level sufficient to warrant a\npositive exemption under humanitarian or compassionate grounds. The Applicant\ntook particular exception to this finding since the Immigration Officer had\nfound that she had been employed in Canada for many years\, had enrolled in courses\,\nand had volunteered in community organizations. In light of these findings\, the\nApplicant argued that the officer__s decision on this matter was particularly\nunreasonable.\n \n[34]          \nIn this regard\, as\nnoted above\, the exemption under subsection 25(1) of the Act is an exceptional\nremedy that should not become an alternative means to secure permanent\nresidence status unless humanitarian and compassionate grounds are found to\njustify this remedy. Simply being employed in Canada\nand acting as a responsible citizen is not sufficient\, and other factors must\nbe present justifying humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Moreover\, as\nalready noted\, the assessment of the evidence and the weight given to each\nfactor in an application based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds are\nmatters which properly belong to the Minister. This Court may have assessed the\nevidence differently or given more weight to some of the factors\, however this\nis not its mandate.\n \n[35]          \nIn light of the\nabove\, the decision of the Immigration Officer in this case __falls within a\nrange of possible\, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the\nfacts and law__ (Dunsmuir\, supra at para. 47).\n \nDisposition\n[36]          \nConsequently the\napplication for judicial review shall be denied.\n \nCertified question\n[37]          \nAt the hearing the\nparties requested an opportunity to make submissions on a certified question\nonce this decision was communicated to them. Each party shall have until Monday\nNovember 30th\, 2009 to propose in writing to the Court\, if deemed\nappropriate\, a serious question of general importance to be considered for\ncertification pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the Act.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nJUDGMENT\n \nTHE COURT JUDGES AND DECIDES that the application for judicial review is\ndenied.\n \n \n \n__Robert\nM.

Preliminary\n[1]              \nThis\nCourt has repeatedly confirmed that the accumulation of contradictions between a\nclaimant__s testimony\, port of entry statements and Personal Information Form\n(PIF) or that of another claimant\, as well as the omission of elements in the\nPIF that are crucial to his or her claim may legitimately serve as a basis for\na negative credibility finding (Eustace v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, 2005 FC 1553\, 144 A.C.W.S. (3d) 132 at para. 6\, 10-11; Tejeda\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 421\, [2009] F.C.J.\nNo. 542 (QL) at para. 15; Olmos v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration)\, 2008 FC 809\, 169 A.C.W.S.

Consequently\, the Court must show significant\ndeference to this type of finding: \n[16]      The RPD has a\nwell-established expertise in determining questions of facts\, particularly\,\nas is the case here\, in the evaluation of the applicant__s credibility and\nsubjective fear of persecution. The Court will not intervene in findings of\nfact reached by the RPD unless they are found to be unreasonable\,\ncapricious or unsupported by the evidence (Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of\nEmployment and Immigration) (F.C.A.)\, [1993] F.C.J. No. 732; Navarro\,\nabove at paragraph 18) . . . (Emphasis added).\n \n(Serrato v.

Introduction\n[3]              \nThis\nis an application for judicial review of a decision by the Refugee Protection\nDivision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) dated April 1\, 2009\,\ndetermining that the applicants are not __Convention refugees__ or __persons in\nneed of protection__ under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act\, S.C. 2001\, c. 27 (IRPA).\n \n[4]              \nThat\ndecision was based on the applicants__ lack of credibility and the availability\nof state protection. \n \nIII.  Facts\n[5]              \nThe\napplicants\, a man\, his wife and their son are Mexican citizens. The refugee\nclaim turns on the narrative of Mr. Fernando Quintero Cienfuegos\, the principal\napplicant. \n \n[6]              \nThe\napplicants__ difficulties purportedly began when Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos__\nfather\, who had worked for the Institutional Revolution Party (IRP)\, left that\nparty for the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PDR).\n \n[7]              \nMr.\nQuintero Cienfuegos__ parents left Mexico for Canada where they\nsought refugee protection following alleged threats by IRP members against Mr. Quintero\nCienfuegos__ father.\n \n[8]              \nThe\napplicants claim that they fear for their life because certain members of the\nIRP who were looking for Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos__ father made death threats against\nthem.\nIV.  Issue\n[9]              \nIs\nthe Board__s decision reasonable?\n \nV.  Analysis\n[10]          \nThe\nCourt concurs with the respondent. \n[11]          \nThe\nBoard__s decision is based on the evidence adduced\, can be reasonably inferred\nfrom it and complies with the applicable legal principles. \n \nA.  Credibility\n                        a.  The\napplicants are not credible\n[12]          \nAfter\nconsidering all the evidence\, the Board found that the applicants were not\ncredible because of numerous failings concerning essential elements of their\nrefugee claims that tarnished their evidence. \n \n[13]          \nThe\nBoard identified a number of inconsistencies in the applicants__ evidence. \n \n[14]          \nFirst\,\nthe Board observed that Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos__ testimony contradicted his port\nof entry statements as to whether he knew the identity of his persecutors. Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos\nindicated at the port of entry that he did not know who his persecutors were;\nhowever\, he stated at the hearing that his persecutor\, one Toribio\, was an IRP employee\nresponsible for transportation. Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos was unable to justify\nthis inconsistency to the Board__s satisfaction (Decision at pp. 3-4 at para.\n11-12).\n[15]          \nSecond\,\nMr. Quintero Cienfuegos gave evidence contradicting his father__s PIF about the\ndate his father left the IRP in November 2005\, while his father stated in his PIF\nthat he left in February 2006 (Decision at p. 4 at para. 13).\n \n[16]          \nIn\naddition\, the Board emphasized the fact that when it confronted Mr. Quintero\nCienfuegos about this\, he did not provide an explanation but attempted to __get around the question\nby giving an answer that had nothing to do with the question put to him__ (Decision at\np. 4\, para. 13).\n \n[17]          \nNext\, the Board noted\na significant omission in the applicants__ PIF that pertains to the core issue\nof their refugee claims.\n \n[18]          \nThey\ndid not state that Toribio was looking for Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos because he\nknew that Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos was aware of the fraud he had committed when\nhe was responsible for transportation at the IRP.\n \n[19]          \nMr.\nQuintero Cienfuegos was unable to justify this omission because he himself had\ntestified that he was aware of this information before he left Mexico. In fact\, it\nwas because of this information that his father recommended he come to Canada to seek\nrefugee protection.\n \nb.  The\nmerits of the Board__s decision\n[20]          \nIn\nlight of the foregoing\, it was open to the Board to determine that these inconsistencies\nand omissions undermined the applicants__ credibility.\n[21]          \nThis\nCourt also held in Moscol v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 657\, 170 A.C.W.S. (3d) 604\, that the Board can make a negative\ncredibility finding against a refugee claimant based on a single false\nstatement made to an immigration officer at the port of entry: \n[21]      The case law states that\ndifferences between the claimant__s statement at the port of entry and the\nclaimant__s testimony are enough to justify a negative credibility finding when\nthese contradictions bear on elements that are central to the claim: Chen v.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 FC 767\, [2005]\nF.C.J. No. 959 (QL)\, at paragraph 23 and Neame v. Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 378\n(QL). Further\, the RPD is entitled to assess a claimant__s credibility based\non a single inconsistency where the impugned evidence is a significant\naspect of the claim: see Nsombo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2004 FC 505\, [2004]\nF.C.J. No. 648 (QL).\n(Emphasis added)\n \n[22]          \nA\nclaimant__s demeanour while testifying is another recognized ground for making a\nnegative credibility finding (Singh v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC 62\, 159 A.C.W.S. (3d) 568 at para.\n13-14).\n \n[23]          \nAdditionally\,\nwith respect\, the applicants__ Memorandum does not advance any argument that\ncould invalidate the Board__s decision in its entirety. \n \n[24]          \nIn\nfact\, the applicants disputed only one of the Board__s negative credibility\nfindings (Applicants__ Record (AR) at pp. 19-20\, para. 6-12).\n \n[25]          \nThe\nnegative credibility finding is determinative per se\, and the failure to\nprove that it is unreasonable is sufficient to defeat this application (Salim\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 FC 1592\, 144\nA.C.W.S. (3d) 326 at para. 31; Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and\nImmigration) [1995] 3 S.C.R. 593\, 58 A.C.W.S. (3d) 287 at para. 147).\n[26]          \nThe\nfindings that were not challenged must be presumed to be true and constitute a\nsufficient basis for justifying the dismissal of this application for judicial\nreview.\n \n[27]          \nIn\naddition\, with respect to the applicants__ submissions in their Memorandum that the\nBoard did not take into consideration Mr. Quintero Cienfuegos__s testimony and\nexplanations about his fear of persecution (AR at p. 20)\, based on the facts in\nthe record and the evidence\, the Board determined that the applicants were not\ncredible. As this Court stated recently:\n[13]      The Applicants challenge the\nBoard__s credibility findings with broad assertions that the Board essentially\ngot it wrong.  They say that their explanations for the matters of concern\nto the Board were reasonable and that the testimonial failings identified by\nthe Board were not important.  While acknowledging that there were\n__problems__ with Ms. Mantilla Cortes__ evidence\, the Applicants contend that the\nBoard__s reasons for rejecting that testimony involve minutia and failed to\naddress the central aspects of their allegations of persecution. \n \n[14]      The fundamental problem with\nthis argument is that the weaknesses in Ms. Mantilla Cortes__ testimony\nwent far beyond matters of insignificant detail.  As counsel for the\nRespondent accurately pointed out\, Ms. Mantilla Cortes was frequently\ninconsistent about the identity of the agents of persecution and\, in that\nregard\, gave evidence that was contradictory to the statements provided by other\nmembers of her family.  The Board also noted Ms. Mantilla Cortes__\nvagueness about the details of the ransom allegedly paid on behalf of her\nbrother and it identified several important omissions and inconsistencies among\nthe various narratives provided by Ms. Mantilla Cortes and by other\nmembers of the family concerning material aspects of the alleged\npersecution.  Finally\, the Board was not impressed by Ms. Mantilla Cortes__\ndemeanour and it specifically noted a lack of spontaneity in her responses to\nkey questions.  \n \n[15]      It is not the role of the Court\non judicial review to re-weigh the evidence or to draw its own inferences from\nthat evidence.  The Board is\, after all\, in the best position to assess\nthe credibility of the witnesses who appear before it.  Here the Board__s\ncredibility findings were reasonably supported by the evidence and I am\,\ntherefore\, not satisfied that the Board erred in this aspect of its\nanalysis.  \n(Cortes v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 254\, 165 A.C.W.S. (3d) 509).\n \n[28]          \nThe\nBoard correctly assessed the merits of the applicants__ fear. \n \n[29]          \nIt\nis the Board__s role to assess the evidence adduced and to draw the necessary\ninferences from it (Javaid v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2004 FC 205\, 129 A.C.W.S. (3d) 169 at para. 24; Velinova v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 268\, 324 F.T.R. 180 at para. 21; Saleem\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 389\,\n166 A.C.W.S. (3d) 321 at para. 37; Naar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship\nand Immigration)\, 2007 FC 1298\, 163 A.C.W.S. (3d) 116 at para. 268).\n \n[30]          \nEssentially\,\nthe applicants are asking this Court to reassess the evidence and to substitute\nits opinion for the Board__s. The principle is clear: judicial review does not\npermit the Court to reweigh the evidence. In Zrig v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2003 FCA 178\, the Court of Appeal confirmed\nthis principle in unequivocal terms:\n[42]      . . . What the appellant is actually asking\nthis Court to do is what we cannot do on an application for judicial review\,\nthat is\, to reassess the evidence that was before the Refugee Division. \n \n(Also\, Kar v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 143\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 171 (QL); Gutierrez\nv. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 487\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 617 (QL) at\npara. 14).\n \n[31]          \nIn\nlight of the foregoing\, the Board__s decision is reasonable\, and the\nintervention of this Court is not warranted.\n \nB.  Availability\nof state protection\n[32]          \nEven\nif the Board had found the applicants credible\, it concluded\, after analyzing all\nthe evidence\, that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption of state\nprotection through clear and convincing evidence (Decision at p. 5\, para. 17; Canada\n(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Carillo\, 2008 FCA 94\,\n[2008] 4 F.C.R. 636 at para. 26\, 30\, 38; Sosa v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 275\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 343 (QL) at\npara. 23; Pacasum v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 822\, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1024 (QL) at para. 22).\n \n[33]          \nIn\nfact\, the applicants simply did not give the Mexican authorities any\nopportunity to protect them. They did not file a complaint with the police or\nthe public prosecutor__s office (Decision at p. 5\, para. 18). Moreover\, the\napplicants admitted this in their Memorandum (AR at p. 21\, para. 15). Instead\,\nthe applicants chose to come to Canada even though a refugee protection claim\nin a state that is a signatory to the Convention must be a solution of last\nresort (Lopez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC\n198\, 165 A.C.W.S. (3d) 514 at para. 22).\n \n[34]          \nThus\,\nit was completely legitimate for the Board to determine that the applicants did\nnot rebut the presumption of state protection. The following comments from the\ndecision in Ramirez v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 1214\, [2008] F.C.J. No. 1533 (QL)\,\nare relevant:\n[27]      The applicant did not follow\nup on the report she filed belatedly against her ex-spouse nor did she seek\nassistance from organizations that protect battered women; she simply sought\nrefuge with family and told her in-laws what her ex-spouse had done. How can\nshe now conclude that her country__s protection was ineffective when she did not\nreally test it seriously? \n \n[28]      The onus was on the applicant\nto first seek protection from the Mexican state before asking another country\nfor protection. She says she did not do so because she did not believe that the\nprotection provided in Mexico for women in her situation was effective. Doubting the\neffectiveness of state protection when she did not really test it does not\nrebut the presumption of state protection in her country of origin. (Emphasis added).\n \n[35]          \nAs\nfor the applicants__ submissions that they did not file a complaint because the\none filed by Mr. Fernando Quintero Cienfuegos__ father had not been followed up\,\nthe Board was correct in finding that this was not sufficient to rebut the\npresumption of state protection. This Court has repeatedly stated that evidence\nthat one or more police officers refused to act on a refugee claimant__s\ncomplaint or that an investigation led nowhere is not sufficient. That cannot\nbe the basis for automatically finding that state protection is not available (Navarro\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 358\,\n169 A.C.W.S. (3d) 626 at para. 15-17; Villasenor v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 1080\, 157 A.C.W.S. (3d) 818 at\npara. 15; Chagoya v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 721\, [2008] F.C.J. No. 908 (QL) at para. 4; Kadenko v. Canada (Minister\nof Citizenship and Immigration) (1996)\, 206 N.R. 272\, 68 A.C.W.S. (3d) 334;\nSantos v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC\n793\, 159 A.C.W.S. (3d) 267 at para. 15).\n \n[36]          \nMoreover\,\nwith respect to their argument that even if they had filed a complaint\, nothing\nwould have happened because of the generalized corruption that prevails in\nMexico\, it is clear from the reasons for decision that\, after weighing the credible\nobjective documentary evidence\, the Board acknowledged that the situation in Mexico is not\nperfect. That being said\, the Board noted that Mexico__s protection is available\nin this case and that the Mexican authorities are making serious efforts to\nprotect the population and that __there are institutions and organizations in that\ncountry that function normally__. (Decision at p. 6 at para. 20-21).\n \n[37]          \nOn\nmore than one occasion\, this Court has upheld decisions determining that the presumption\nof state protection has not been rebutted in a Mexican context (Sosa v.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2009 FC 275 at para.\n22; Gutierrez\, above\, at para. 17; Luna v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 1132\, [2008] F.C.J. No. 1501 (QL) at\npara. 14; Sanchez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\,\n2008 FC 134\, 165 A.C.W.S.

(3d) 497 at para. 11).\n \n[38]          \nThus\,\nthe Board was justified in determining that\, in the circumstances of this case\,\nthe applicants had not done what was required to take advantage of their\ncountry__s protection.\n \n[39]          \nThe\nfinding concerning the availability of state protection is sufficient per se\nto dismiss the applicants__ application (Gutierrez\, above\, at para. 11; Munoz\nv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2008 FC 648\,\n167 A.C.W.S. (3d) 960\, at para. 18; Richardson v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2007 FC 1009\, 160 A.C.W.S. (3d) 855 at para.\n14-17).\n \nVI.  Conclusion\n[40]          \nThe\napplicants did not put forward any serious argument regarding the Board__s determination\nthat state protection was available\, that could support a finding by this Court\nthat the Board__s reasons are perverse\, capricious or completely unfounded.\n \n[41]          \nBased\non the foregoing\, the application for judicial review is dismissed. \n\n\n \nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURT ORDERS that \n1.         the applicant__s application for\njudicial review is dismissed; \n2.         no\nquestion of serious question of general importance is certified.\n \n \n__Michel M.J.

The Division even found that the plaintiff's claim lacked a credible basis pursuant to s. 69.1(9.1) of the Act.\n [5]                 In July 2001 the plaintiff filed an immigrant visa exemption application pursuant to s. 114(2) of the Act\, alleging that humanitarian considerations warranted an exemption to the proper application of the Act. In particular\, he alleged a valid fear of persecution on the ground that he would be exposed to a term of imprisonment if he returned to Tunisia because of a conviction for drug trafficking.\n [6]                 By a letter dated October 2\, 2001\, the Immigration officer informed the plaintiff that he had concluded that the plaintiff was not likely to suffer abuse if he returned to Tunisia\, and also concluded that there were not sufficient humanitarian considerations to justify an exception to the proper application of the Act.\n\n\nPOINTS AT ISSUE\n             1.         Did the Immigration officer have a duty to disclose the analysis of the risk of return which he made personally and to give the plaintiff an opportunity to make comments before reaching a final decision on the immigrant visa exemption application?\n             2.         Was the Immigration officer's decision reasonable?\nANALYSIS\n \nDid the Immigration officer have a duty to disclose the analysis of the risk of return which he made personally and to give the plaintiff an opportunity to make comments before reaching a final decision on the immigrant visa exemption application?\n [7]                 No\, the Immigration officer did not have a duty to disclose the analysis of the risk of return and give the plaintiff an opportunity to make comments before reaching a final decision on the immigrant visa exemption application.\n [8]                 The plaintiff submitted that the Immigration officer failed in his duty of fairness and rendered an unreasonable decision. The plaintiff relied entirely on Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] 4 F.C. 407 (F.C.A.).\n\n\n [9]                 In Haghighi\, supra\, the Court concluded that before rendering his decision the Immigration officer contravened the fairness obligation by not telling the plaintiff the content of the risk assessment by the review officer and by not giving him a reasonable opportunity to try to identify errors or omissions in that assessment.\n [10]            Haghighi\, supra may be distinguished from the case at bar on three grounds. First\, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Immigration officer had a duty to disclose to the plaintiff a report which was prepared by a third party\, namely a post-claim determination officer (PCDO)\, with which she agreed\, and that she should have given him an opportunity to make corrections to that report. No report was filed by a third party in the case at bar. The analysis of the risk of return was made by an Immigration officer alone and is part of the final decision.\n [11]            Secondly\, earlier decisions of this Court have been hesitant to impose on the Immigration officer a duty to disclose to the plaintiff the content of his or her analysis of the risk of return. In Soto v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1207 (F.C.T.D.)\, Lemieux J. concluded that a post-claim determination officer had a duty to disclose to the plaintiff a return risk assessment report which he made himself before reaching a final decision. In Mia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1584 (F.C.T.D.)\, McKeown J. expressed his disagreement with that reasoning as follows:\n\n\n[para. 11] . . . With respect\, I disagree that the principles of fairness require a PCDO conducting a risk assessment to determine if the applicant is a member of the PDRCC class to disclose the risk assessment prior to making his decision. In my view\, this would be tantamount to a decision-maker being required to provide its reasons for the decision for comment prior to making the final decision. This is a case where the person who reviewed the evidence made the decision. No one else was involved. This is not a case where the decision maker is receiving input from other persons than the applicant.\n         [12]            Further\, in Siavashi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2000] F.C.J. No. 1132 (F.C.T.D.)\, McKeown J. stated that it was not usual to give the parties reasons in order to get their comments before the decision itself was rendered:\n[para 10] I cannot agree with this analysis since the Baker case\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817\, specifically provides that the summary document constitutes the reasons. It is not normal to provide reasons to the parties for comments before the issuance of the decision. The failure to disclose the summary report would only cause a problem if new facts were included in the summary which were not known to the Applicant. This is not the situation in this case.\n \n [13]            I entirely concur in that reasoning. Accepting the plaintiff's argument in the case at bar would amount to requiring administrative decision-makers to provide a draft of their decisions to plaintiffs before making a final decision\, which would be ridiculous.     \n\n\n [14]            Thirdly\, the return risk assessment made by the Immigration officer was based largely on the contradictions and inconsistencies already noted by the Refugee Division when it dismissed the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff was fully aware of that decision at the time he made his immigrant visa exemption application. Despite this\, the plaintiff did not provide the necessary explanations when he filed his application. He is now trying to provide them (at paras. 40 to 49 of his affidavit). In Haghighi\, supra\, the Federal Court of Appeal was careful to state that disclosure of the PCDO report should not be used by the plaintiff as a pretext to submit arguments which he could have presented earlier:\n[37] . . . I would only add that an apportunity to draw attention to alleged errors or omissions in the PCDO'S report is not an invitation to applicants to reargue their case to the immigration officer.\n [15]            I find that the Immigration officer did not fail in his duty of fairness since\, for all the aforementioned reasons\, there was no duty to disclose his return risk analysis to the plaintiff. Further\, the plaintiff had an opportunity\, when he filed his immigrant visa exemption application\, to provide the explanations he is now seeking to provide. At the judicial review stage\, it is no longer the proper forum for such matters.\nWas the Immigration officer's decision reasonable?\n [16]            Yes\, the Immigration officer's decision was reasonable.\nRisk of return to Tunisia\n [17]            The risk of return analysis was a document titled [TRANSLATION] ""Opinion"" (Exhibit B in the affidavit by Jean-Marc Sirois in the defendant's memorandum)\, which was conducted personally by the Immigration officer. The Immigration officer referred to the risk of return as follows:\n\n\n[TRANSLATION]\n[page 2] Despite the RD's unfavourable decision regarding the plaintiff\, I still considered everything which was submitted to me in writing in order to determine whether he could be exposed to an objectively identifiable risk.\n \nAfter reviewing the plaintiff's complete personal immigration file\, I have come to the conclusion that no such risk exists as the facts he set out do not support his allegations of a fear of a possible return to Tunisia.\n \n[My emphasis.]\n         [18]            It was reasonable for the Immigration officer to conclude that the plaintiff was not likely to suffer abuse if he returned to Tunisia\, and there were no sufficient humanitarian considerations to warrant an exemption to the proper application of the Act.\nRefugee Division's findings\n [19]            It was also reasonable for the Immigration officer to agree with the findings of the Refugee Division\, in particular since the course of events described by the plaintiff was inconsistent. In the same document\, the Immigration officer wrote:\n[TRANSLATION]\n[page 2] There were several inconsistencies in his story\, the chief ones being identified in the RD's written reasons. Thus\, the plaintiff was not able to show that he had a valid fear of persecution in Tunisia or that there was a credible basis for his claim.\n. . . . .\n \n\n\nI will not go back to that question\, as it is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the RD. The course of events seems inconsistent to me also and to date the plaintiff has provided no satisfactory explanation.\n \n[My emphasis.]\n \n \n \nPenalties imposed on plaintiff\n [20]            Further\, it was reasonable for the Immigration officer to conclude that even assuming the plaintiff had really been convicted in Tunisia the penalties imposed on the plaintiff were neither inhumane nor excessive\, in view of the seriousness of the offences with which the plaintiff was charged. Similarly\, the Immigration officer wrote:\n[TRANSLATION]\n[pages 2-3] . . . The allegations of a risk of return seem somewhat exaggerated to me in view of the present situation in Tunisia\, which seems to be less serious than the plaintiff would have us believe.\n \nIn general\, the plaintiff attributed his fear of the Tunisian authorities to the following:\n \n-having been unjustly charged and convicted in a drug case;\n \n-being in Italy throughout the proceeding;\n \n-having been sentenced to serve terms of 10 and 5 years' imprisonment in Tunisia;\n \n-his return was a sort of extradition\, like other well-known prisoners of conscience.\n \n. . . . .\n \n[page 3] In the circumstances\, I do not consider that the imprisonment alleged by the plaintiff could represent inhuman or excessive punishment in view of the seriousness of the offences he described.\n \n. . . . .\n\n\n \n[page 5] After considering all the facts alleged\, the possibilities that the plaintiff could be threatened or even subject to abuse in Tunisia do not seem to me to be sufficient to warrant serious consideration.\n \n[My emphasis.]\n \nDocuments lacking in credibility\n [21]            The Immigration officer reasonably attached little weight to the documents filed by the plaintiff regarding his criminal record in Tunisia. The Immigration officer indicated:\n[TRANSLATION]\n[page 3] In his comments in support of his PRAC\, he stated that this was due to the fact that at his hearing he did not have the relevant documents to support these facts. However\, a copy of the latter now accompanied his residence application. Unfortunately\, these documents are either undated\, unsigned or unauthenticated by a seal\, a statement by a translator or a seal by the authorities: in general\, their form leaves much to be desired. For these reasons\, I cannot attach any significant weight to them in my decision.\n        Not a case of a well-known political opponent being sought\n [22]            Finally\, the Immigration officer could reasonably find that the plaintiff's case differed from that of well-known political opponents.\n [23]            The plaintiff was not politically involved and there was nothing in the evidence to indicate any interest by the authorities in him. To illustrate\, the Immigration officer wrote:\n\n\n[TRANSLATION]\n[page 4] . . . The plaintiff did not establish that he was being sought in his country. In his PIF\, he answered ""no"" each time to questions 20 and 21\, namely whether he was being sought or had been convicted of an offence. Further\, in his PRAC\, to question J\, ""organizations to which you have belonged since age 18""\, he indicated ""I have never been a member of an organization"".\n \nAccordingly\, I do not believe that the plaintiff is politically involved in his country. I also do not believe he is of any interest whatever to the Tunisian authorities\, and no mention has so far been made of any particular warrant.\n \n. . . . .\n \n[My emphasis.]\n \n[page 5] In spite of everything\, I do not think the plaintiff has been targeted by the authorities in his country\, that he is the subject of reprisals\, as he did not persuade me that he was wanted in Tunisia. I also do not believe that his case is comparable to that of well-known figures whom he mentioned in his submissions\, as he did not himself allege any political involvement in his personal background.\n \n [24]            As to the assessment of other humanitarian considerations\, once again the plaintiff did not show the Court that the Immigration officer's conclusions were unreasonable.\n [25]            The application for judicial review is accordingly dismissed.\n [26]            Both parties agreed in suggesting that the following question be certified: [TRANSLATION] ""When an Immigration officer makes a decision on landing pursuant to s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act\, based on alleged risks of return\, should that officer disclose his findings on the risks of return so as to give the plaintiff an opportunity to respond before making a final decision in the case?""\n\n\n [27]            At the risk of disappointing the two parties in the case at bar\, I do not feel that this question is a serious question of general importance within the meaning of s. 83(1) of the Immigration Act. I think that the Court of Appeal's decision in Haghighi\, supra\, is quite clear enough and the subsequent judgments of the Federal Court\, including McKeown J. in Mia\, supra and Sia Vashi\, supra\, Hansen J. in Chen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2002] F.C.J. No. 341\, and Lemieux J. in Okutubo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, [2002] F.C.J. No. 207\, which appears to qualify his decision in Soto\, supra\, confirm that the rules of fairness are not infringed when the officer who has made the risk assessment is the same one who made the final decision on the visa exemption application.\n [28]            Further\, the risk of return assessment is an opinion which is part of the decision and of its reasons\, and that opinion does not have to be disclosed to the plaintiff in advance for comment.\n [29]            I therefore consider that this question has already been decided and so it will not be certified.\n\n\n \n    \n ""Pierre Blais""\n\n                                    Judge\n\n\n \n\n \n \nCertified true translation\n \n \n \nSuzanne M.

The trial judgment\,\nin its final result\, runs contrary to the Supreme Court of Canada__s call for\nthe reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interests and aspirations.\n \nThe\nApplicants intend to intervene to address a justiciable issue of public\ninterest;\n \nThe Applicant\nElders have special expertise with respect to the appropriate treatment of\nElder witnesses by the Court and during pre-trial disclosure and discovery\, and\nat trial;\n \nThe\nApplicants are able to provide a different perspective on questions raised in this\nappeal than the ones to be provided by the parties;\n \nThe\nApplicants have no other reasonable or efficient recourse to address the issue\nbefore the Court;\n \n \n[3]              \nThe Orders\nsought are as follows:\nORDER that\nthe Assembly of Treaty Chiefs (Alberta)\, as represented by\nGrand Chief Wayne Moonias\, Grand Chief Charles Weaselhead and Grand Chief\nJoseph Whitehead\, and Elder Pete Waskahat\, Elder Chief Reg Crow Shoe and Elder\nMike Beaver be added as Interveners in this proceeding.\n \nORDER that\nthe Applicants (Proposed Interveners) be allowed to present written submissions\nin the form of a Memorandum of Fact and Law in accordance with Rule 70 of the Federal\nCourt Rules 1998 by March 20\, 2009\, and be allowed to present oral\nsubmissions in support of this intervention during the hearing of the\nproceeding scheduled to begin April 20\, 2009 in Ottawa.\n \n \n[4]              \nTwo\nappeals\, one on the ultimate result of the trial and the other on the costs\naward\, have been consolidated.\n[5]              \nThe\nproposed interveners have been aware of both the underlying action and the\nwithin appeals for some time.\n \n[6]              \nThe\nproposed interveners did not file their motion to intervene until January 23\,\n2009\, some five months after these appeals were set down for hearing and over a\nmonth after Her Majesty the Queen filed her memorandum on the merits.\n \n[7]              \nFurther\,\nthe proposed interveners request that their memorandum in respect of their\nintervention be served and filed on March 20\, 2009\, four weeks before this\nCourt is to hear oral argument in these appeals. \n \n[8]              \nThe\nproposed interveners have provided no reasonable explanation as to why they did\nnot bring this application at an earlier date.\n \n[9]              \nIn\narriving at my decision to dismiss the motion to intervene brought by the\nproposed interveners\, I have considered the factors relevant to an application\nfor intervention in Canadian Union of Public Employees v.

No. 220 (QL)\, paragraph 8 (C.A.).\n \n[10]          \nThe\nactions underlying these appeals have a lengthy and complex procedural history\ninvolving a trial\, an appeal resulting in an Order for re-trial followed by\nyears of case management resulting in a dismissal of the plaintiffs__ actions by\nJudgment dated March 7\, 2008.\n[11]          \nOne of the\nkey factors to be considered on a motion to intervene is whether the position\nof the proposed intervener will be adequately defended by one of the existing\nparties.\n \n[12]          \nThe\nproposed interveners assert that they will assist this Court in understanding\nthe role that the Aboriginal perspective plays in the fair determination of\nAboriginal litigation.\n \n[13]          \nHowever\,\nthe appellants are themselves Indian Bands.\n \n[14]          \nDuring the\ncourse of the trial\, the appellants made written and oral submissions on how\nlay evidence and oral history evidence is dealt with in the jurisprudence.\n \n[15]          \nThe\nperspective that the proposed interveners wish to bring is duplicative of that\nof the parties to the appeals.\n \n[16]          \nAs No_l\nJ.A. stated in Li v.

In the Federal Court and in this\nCourt\, the innovators have argued on a number of grounds that the Minister was\nwrong to issue notices of compliance to Apotex and Novopharm without first\nrequiring them to address\, under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance)\nRegulations\, certain patents listed on the patent register after Apotex and\nNovopharm had filed their respective abbreviated new drug submissions.\n \n[3]              \nMuch of the argument on appeal was based on the\ninterpretation and application of subsection 5(1) of the Patented Medicines\n(Notice of Compliance) Regulations\, SOR/93-133 following the decision of\nthe Supreme Court of Canada in AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister\nof Health)\, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 560\, 2006 S.C.C. 49. These regulations were\namended by SOR/2006-242 effective October 5\, 2006 and introduce a new regime.\n \n[4]              \nWe do not consider it necessary to discuss the arguments in\ndetail because we are in substantial agreement with the decision of Justice\nHughes and with his reasons.\n\n \n[5]              \nWe differ\nfrom Justice Hughes on only one point.  As an alternative basis for dismissing\nthe application of Ferring Inc.\, Justice Hughes concluded that Ferring Inc. did\nnot have standing to bring an application for judicial review of the decision\nof the Minister. We do not agree. In our view\, Ferring Inc. did have standing\nto challenge that decision because it was made by the Minister in the course of\nhis administration of the NOC Regulations. However\, that does not alter the\noutcome because Justice Hughes dismissed the application of Ferring Inc. on the\nmerits.\n \n[6]              \nWe have concluded that the analytical approach adopted by\nthe Minister in these four appeals was adequate for the factual circumstances\nof these cases. Whether it is adequate for all possible circumstances\,\nincluding the circumstances of appeal A__189__07\, which has been\ndismissed on the ground of mootness\, is a question upon which we express no\nopinion.\n \n[7]              \nWe also note that there remains some confusion about the\nappropriate standard of review to be applied by the Federal Court in an\napplication for judicial review of a determination by the Minister that a\ngeneric drug manufacturer is not required to address a particular patent under\nthe NOC Regulations. In our view\, the standard of review is correctness for\nquestions of law\, and patent unreasonableness for questions of fact (AstraZeneca\nCanada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health)\,\n2004 FC 1277\, per Justice Kelen at paragraph 33).\n \n[8]              \nI would add that where there is a mixed question of law and\nfact then the standard of review is patent unreasonableness unless the question\nof law is extricable from the question of fact in which case the question of\nlaw is determined on the basis of correctness.\n[9]              \nAccordingly\, these appeals will be dismissed with costs.\n \n[10]          \nA copy of these reasons shall be filed in Court File\nNumbers A-161-07\, A-162-07 and A__163-07.\n \n \n \n \n""J.

Conclusion\n\n\n193\n\n\n\n[1]              \nTrazodone\, also referred to as trazadone\, is an\nantidepressant drug. On January 25\, 1988\, Apotex Inc. filed a submission with\nthe Health Protection Branch of Health Canada in which it sought approval to\nsell a generic version of trazodone in Canada. Apotex received approval seven\nyears later\, on February 28\, 1995. By that time\, two generic drug\nmanufacturers\, competitors of Apotex\, had received approval to sell generic\nversions of trazodone in Canada.\n[2]              \nIn October 1998\, Apotex commenced an action in\ndamages naming Her Majesty the Queen\, as representative of the Minister of\nHealth and officials within the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada\, as\ndefendant. In these reasons the defendant is referred to as Health Canada.\n[3]              \nIn its action\, Apotex alleged\, among other\nthings\, that in the course of considering its drug submission officials of the Health\nProtection Branch committed misfeasance in a public office and also acted\nnegligently. Apotex also alleged a breach of contract based on violation of a settlement\nagreement entered into between Apotex and Health Canada while Apotex__\nsubmission was under consideration.\n[4]              \nApotex__ action was bifurcated in the Federal\nCourt. The action went to trial on the issue of liability. If required\, the\nissue of damages was to be addressed by the Federal Court at a later date.\n[5]              \nFor lengthy reasons cited as 2014 FC 1087\, the\nFederal Court found Health Canada was liable in damages because its officials\ncommitted the torts of misfeasance in a public office and negligence. These\nconclusions were based on a finding that officials of Health Canada both\ndeliberately and negligently failed to adhere to the terms of the settlement\nagreement referred to above. The Federal Court went on to find that Apotex__\ndamages should be reduced on the ground that Apotex had failed to mitigate its\ndamages. The Federal Court dismissed the claim in contract because it found\nthat the action was commenced outside the applicable limitation period.\n[6]              \nTwo appeals and a cross-appeal are brought from\nthe judgment of the Federal Court. For the purpose of this introduction\, the following\nsummary of the issues raised on the appeals is sufficient.\n[7]              \nIn its appeal (A-554-14)\, Apotex asserts that\nthe Federal Court erred by:\ni.                   \nfailing to consider whether Health Canada\ncommitted misfeasance in a public office and negligence for reasons apart from\nits treatment of the settlement agreement;\nii.                 \nconcluding that Apotex failed to mitigate its\ndamages; and\,\niii.               \nconcluding that the claim in contract was\nstatute barred.\n[8]              \nIn its cross-appeal\, Health Canada argues that\nthe Federal Court erred by finding there was a breach of the settlement\nagreement.\n[9]              \nIn its appeal (A-553-14)\, Health Canada submits\nthat the Federal Court erred:\ni.                   \nin law in finding that the settlement agreement\ncreated a relationship of proximity;\nii.                 \nin law by failing to negate any prima facie\nduty of care based on residual policy considerations;\niii.               \nin the alternative\, by making palpable and\noverriding errors of fact with respect to both the standard of care and\nmisfeasance in a public office; and\,\niv.               \nfurther and in the alternative\, by finding\nmisfeasance on the facts as found.\n[10]          \nThese appeals were consolidated by order of the\nCourt. In accordance with the consolidation order\, a copy of these reasons\nshall be placed in each Court file.\n[11]          \nFor the reasons which follow\, I have concluded\nthat the Federal Court committed a single error that warrants intervention by\nthis Court: the Federal Court erred by concluding that Apotex failed to\nmitigate its loss. It follows that I would dismiss Health Canada__s appeal. I\nwould allow Apotex__ appeal in part and vary paragraph one of the judgment of\nthe Federal Court to read:\nApotex is entitled to damages to be assessed\non the basis set out in the reasons of the Federal Court issued on November 18\,\n2014\, with the exception that Apotex did not fail to mitigate its damages.\nIn all other respects I would dismiss\nApotex__ appeal and Health Canada__s cross-appeal.\n[12]          \nI begin my analysis by briefly setting out the\nfacts required to situate these appeals. I then review the decision of the\nFederal Court as it relates to the issues raised on these appeals and consider\nthe standard of review to be applied to the decision of the Federal Court.\nFinally\, I apply that standard to the issues raised in the appeals.\nI.                  \nFactual Background\n[13]          \nThe Minister of Health is responsible for\nensuring that drugs sold in Canada are safe and effective for their intended\npurpose. Thus\, no drug may be sold or distributed in Canada unless approved by\nthe Minister through the issuance of a notice of compliance.\n[14]          \nThe present appeals arise from events that took\nplace between 1988 and 1995. During those years\, if a research-based\npharmaceutical company (also referred to as an innovator) sought approval to\nsell a new drug in Canada\, the innovator was required to provide sufficient\ninformation and material to enable the Minister to assess the safety and\neffectiveness of the new drug.\n[15]          \nIf\, during the same period\, a generic drug manufacturer\nwished to obtain approval to sell a generic version of a drug already available\nfor sale in Canada\, the generic manufacturer was required to establish that its\nproduct was bioequivalent to the innovator__s approved drug or to establish\nbioequivalence to a reference product that was known to be safe and effective.\nTwo pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically\nequivalent and if their bioavailability can be expected to be essentially the\nsame. Bioavailability refers generally to the rate and extent to which an\nactive pharmaceutical ingredient is absorbed from the dosage form and becomes\navailable in the body.\n[16]          \nFor the purpose of assessing bioavailability\,\nthe guidelines published in 1981 by the Health Protection Branch stated that __generally__ the bioavailability of a new generic drug\nproduct would be compared to that of an __acceptable\nstandard__. The 1981 Guidelines did not define an __acceptable standard__.\n[17]          \nThe Federal Court found the usual\, but not\ninvariable\, practice from 1988 to 1995 was for a generic drug manufacturer to\ntest its product against the innovator__s drug as approved in Canada (reasons\,\nparagraph 26). Indeed\, it was an admitted fact that during the relevant\ntimeframe the Health Protection Branch approved six drug products on the basis\nof a foreign reference product.\n[18]          \nThe Federal Court described the approval process\nas __tedious__ and noted that a generic drug\nmanufacturer could expect that it would take at least one to two years from the\ndate its submission was filed for a notice of compliance to issue (reasons\,\nparagraph 23).\n[19]          \nOn January 25\, 1988\, Apotex submitted to the\nHealth Protection Branch a new drug submission seeking approval to sell its\ngeneric version of trazodone\, Apo-Trazad (later referred to as Apo-Trazadone). In\nits submission\, Apotex sought to demonstrate that its drug was safe and\neffective by submitting a bioavailability study that referenced a generic drug\nmanufactured in the United States by Barr Laboratories\, referred to as __Barr\nTrazodone__\, instead of a Canadian drug. Barr Trazodone had been approved for\nsale in the United States on the basis of a bioavailability study comparing it\nwith trazodone approved for sale in the United States under the brand name\nDesyrel. Desyrel was sold in the United States by the innovator drug company\nMead Johnson and Company.\n[20]          \nWith its drug submission Apotex also submitted a\nletter dated December 22\, 1987\, from Bristol Laboratories of Canada\, the\nCanadian company approved to sell the Desyrel product in Canada\, to a Canadian\ndoctor\, Dr. Rein. In the letter Bristol advised that the Canadian and American\nDesyrel products were identical (Joint Book of Documents\, tab 24).\n[21]          \nApotex stated that the American authorities had\napproved Barr Trazodone using the United States Desyrel product as a reference and\nthat the Canadian and United States Desyrel products were identical. Therefore\,\nApotex submitted that because Apo-Trazadone was identical to Barr Trazodone\nApotex should be permitted to use the same bioavailability studies relied upon\nby Barr in its American application. Put another way\, Apotex submitted that if\nAmerican and Canadian Desyrel were identical\, the Health Protection Branch should\naccept the bioavailability study that demonstrated that Barr Trazodone and U.S.\nDesyrel were bioequivalent as proof that Apo-Trazadone and Canadian Desyrel\nwere bioequivalent.\n[22]          \nThe Health Protection Branch did not approve\nApotex__ new drug submission. It advised Apotex that there was a __normal requirement__ for a Canadian reference product\nand that Barr Trazodone was not an appropriate reference product unless it\ncould be __conclusively proven__ to be identical\nto __a product known to the Branch\,__ i.e. the __standard trazodone product marketed in Canada__ (Joint\nBook of Documents\, tabs 23 and 32).\n[23]          \nOn February 1\, 1990\, the Health Protection\nBranch advised that it would not require a Canadian reference product if __incontrovertible and verifiable evidence can be provided to\nestablish that the product in a foreign market is identical in all respects to\nthe Canadian product__ (Joint Book of Documents\, tab 40). Thus\, the\nBranch was prepared to accept proof that the Canadian Desyrel was identical to\nthe American Desyrel.\n[24]          \nApotex refused to comply. It rejected what the\nHealth Protection Branch referred to as its __policy__\nthat required a Canadian reference product. Apotex filed an application for\njudicial review on August 13\, 1990\, requesting an order directing that the\nMinister review its application without requiring that the reference product be\npurchased in Canada and further directing the Minister to issue a notice of compliance\nto Apotex (reasons\, paragraph 49).\n[25]          \nThis application for judicial review never\nproceeded to hearing because the parties reached a settlement in November 1990\nand Apotex discontinued the application. The written settlement agreement is\nset out in full at paragraph 51 of the reasons of the Federal Court. In the settlement\nagreement the parties agreed that:\ni.                   \nThe review of Apotex__ new drug submission was\ncontinuing and had not been completed for the purpose of the then applicable Food\nand Drug Regulations (C.R.C. 1978\, c. 870)\, (__Regulations__).\nii.                 \nExisting and any further data provided by Apotex\nto establish that its product was chemically and therapeutically equivalent\nto a drug product sold in Canada would be considered. For the purpose of a comparative\nbioavailability study __the Health Protection Branch is\nprepared to consider evidence to establish equivalency between Canadian\nand non-Canadian reference standards__ (emphasis added).\n[26]          \nAs the Federal Court observed at paragraph 53 of\nits reasons\, __[t]hings did not go well__ after\nthe settlement agreement was concluded. Apotex asserted that the Health\nProtection Branch failed to adhere to the terms of the settlement agreement. On\nJuly 17\, 1991\, Apotex filed a second application for judicial review in which\nit sought two orders of mandamus. First\, Apotex sought an order\ndirecting the Health Protection Branch to review its submission and assess\nwhether the submission adequately established the required safety and\neffectiveness of its drug __without regard to a\ncondition precedent to such review that the reference product tested in the\ncomparative bioavailability study be purchased in Canada or that there be a\ncertification from the manufacturer of the Canadian reference product that it\nis identical to the non-Canadian reference product__. Second\, Apotex\nsought an order directing the Health Protection Branch to issue a notice of\ncompliance to it.\n[27]          \nThe application for judicial review was\ndismissed by the Federal Court on the basis that it was not patently\nunreasonable for the Health Protection Branch to require that a new drug\nsubmission compare the proposed generic drug against a Canadian reference product\n(Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)\, [1993] F.C.J. No. 31\, 59 F.T.R.\n85). The Federal Court did\, however\, conclude that the Health Protection\nBranch__s refusal to consider Apotex__ full submission __because\nof a claimed policy that bioavailability studies be done only with reference to\na Canadian product__ was an unlawful fettering of discretion.\n[28]          \nThe Federal Court also characterized the Health\nProtection Branch__s manner of dealing with Apotex __to\nhave been maladroit\, at times dissembling if not actually misleading.__\nThis said\, the Federal Court did not believe that the Branch __acted in bad faith or with malice.__\n[29]          \nFollowing the second application for judicial\nreview\, the Health Protection Branch re__reviewed Apotex__ submissions\, and\non April 8\, 1994\, concluded that Apotex had not __adequately\nestablished the bioequivalence of Canadian and U.S. Desyrel drug products.__\n[30]          \nApotex then provided further studies which were\nreviewed in June of 1994. Upon review of these further studies\, the Health\nProtection Branch reviewer concluded in a __draft__\nreport dated June 23\, 1994\, (Joint Book of Documents\, tab 164) that:\nIn light of the acknowledgement of chemical\nequivalence\, the nature of the drug substance\, and the results of comparative\ndissolution analyses in a variety of media over the physiological pH range\, I\nhave no outstanding concerns regarding the potential inequivalence of U.S. and\nCanadian marketed Desyrel.\n[31]          \nOn December 16\, 1994\, the Health Protection\nBranch reviewer signed a report which contained only slight revisions to the __draft report__. In it he concluded:\nIn light of the Crown__s acknowledgement of\nchemical equivalence\, the nature of the drug substance\, and the results of\ncomparative dissolution analyses in a variety of media over the physiological\npH range\, I conclude that no basis remains for articulating concerns regarding\nthe potential inequivalence of U.S. and Canadian marketed Desyrel.\n[32]          \nBy January 3\, 1995\, one of the reviewer__s\nsuperiors had read the report. She sent a short note to the reviewer asking how\nthe Health Protection Branch might __extricate__ itself\nfrom the matter.\n[33]          \nThereafter\, a lawyer with the Department of\nJustice sent what the Federal Court characterized to be __a peculiar letter__ to Apotex__ lawyers. The letter indicated\nthat Health Canada was attempting to expedite the review of the drug\nsubmission. The letter also requested that Apotex sign a release\, a copy of\nwhich was enclosed\, releasing Her Majesty and others from __any and all manner of claims\, actions\, causes of action\,\ndebts__.\n[34]          \nAfterwards\, senior counsel at the Department of\nJustice advised that Health Canada would not seek any agreement which would\nlimit any recourse which Apotex might properly have against Health Canada.\n[35]          \nOn February 28\, 1995\, Apotex received its notice\nof compliance. No explanation has been provided for the lengthy delay between\nthe draft and final reports or the significant delay between the final report\nand the issuance of the notice of compliance.\nII.               \nThe Decision of the Federal Court\n[36]          \nThe Federal Court began by reviewing the process\nfor obtaining drug approval in Canada during the period from 1988 to 1995\, and\nthe usual practices of Health Canada during that period. The Court then\nreviewed in some detail the dealings between the parties. Helpfully\, the Court\ntabulated the more relevant documents and events in a 38-page schedule to the\nreasons.\n[37]          \nIn the course of its reasons the Federal Court\nmade a number of findings of fact\, including the following which are relevant\nto the issues raised on these appeals:\ni.                   \nThere was\, at the relevant time\, a general\nunderstanding\, at least within the Health Protection Branch\, that a Canadian\nreference product was required to establish the bioavailability\, and hence the bioequivalence\nof a generic drug. This understanding was not reduced to writing until 1989\,\nafter Apotex__ drug submission was received. This understanding was not an\nexpress requirement of either the Food and Drugs Act\, R.S.C. 1985\, c.\nF-27 or the Regulations (reasons\, paragraphs 29 to 33).\nii.                 \nThere was little evidence to support the Health\nProtection Branch__s assertion that it had a __long-standing__\npolicy of requiring a Canadian reference product. The Health Protection Branch\nwas inconsistent in applying its __policy__.\nHowever\, there was no evidence that the Branch discriminated against Apotex in\nthis regard (reasons\, paragraphs 26\, 71).\niii.               \nIn January 1989\, early in the process\, the\nDirector of the Bureau of Human Prescription Drugs\, Dr. G. Johnson\, sent a\nmemorandum to the Director General of the Drugs Directorate __which clearly draws the lines that [were] followed throughout\nthe history of this matter__ (reasons\, paragraph 39). The Director of the\nBureau wrote:\nTherefore\, on\nthe basis of science alone\, I am inclined to accept the arguments advanced by\nApotex. However\, we should also examine the possibility that we may be\nestablishing a precedent if we follow this course of action that could see us\nforced to accept similar arguments from around the world. What is to prevent\, for example\, Apotex from commissioning a\nbioavailability study comparing the French brand of a product as the standard?\nIf we accept the arguments advanced in this particular case\, we could have a\ndifficult time not allowing this type of study. This could be the start of a\nprocess that would see us lose control over the generic submissions.\n[Emphasis added]\niv.               \nThe Health Protection Branch knew that the\nAmerican reference product Apotex relied upon was identical to its Canadian\ncounterpart\, because the Branch had approved the Canadian innovator__s drug\nusing data provided from the innovator__s U.S. product. However\, Health\nProtection Branch officials refused to look at the Canadian innovator__s file\nbecause of an unwritten internal policy which directed that officials not look\nat the data submitted by the innovator for the purpose of evaluating the\nsubmission of a generic who subsequently sought approval to sell the same drug.\nThus\, the Health Protection Branch required Apotex to prove to the Branch that\nwhich it already knew to be true (reasons\, paragraphs 46 and 25).\nv.                 \nAt the time the settlement agreement was\nconcluded the only outstanding issue between the parties was that of\nbioavailability. Apotex believed that it could demonstrate bioavailability by\nequivalency\, whereas the Health Protection Branch required identicality. The\nsettlement agreement __clearly__ stated that the\nHealth Protection Branch would look at the matter from the point of view of\nequivalency (reasons\, paragraph 54).\nvi.               \nThereafter\, the Health Protection Branch did not\nfollow the terms of the settlement agreement. The Branch __stayed on a path whereby they were insisting upon\nidenticality.__ The Branch was __less than full\nand forthright in its dealings with Apotex.__ There was a deliberate\nattempt by the Branch __to stick to its position as to identicality\nwhile conveying to Apotex a sense that it was willing to be flexible\, which it\nwas not__ (reasons\, paragraph 55).\nvii.             \nApotex was led to believe that if it submitted __a bit more data__ to the Health Protection Branch\,\nparticularly with respect to dissolution rates\, this would be sufficient to\nsatisfy the Branch (reasons\, paragraph 56).\nviii.           \nDespite asserting to Apotex that it was prepared\nto accept evidence as to the equivalency of the American and Canadian reference\nproducts\, the Health Protection Branch was only prepared to consider evidence\nas to bioavailability with reference to a Canadian reference product (reasons\,\nparagraph 71).\nix.               \nThe Health Protection Branch unlawfully fettered\nits discretion by refusing to consider Apotex__ full submissions on the basis\nthat a Canadian reference product was required (reasons\, paragraph 71).\nx.                 \nThe Health Protection Branch misled Apotex into\nthe belief that the Branch was willing to receive further data and review it on\nthe basis of equivalency when the Branch was not willing to do so (reasons\,\nparagraph 71).\nxi.               \nThe Health Protection Branch made a deliberate\nattempt to frustrate Apotex__ submission for a notice of compliance. There\nappeared to have been __endless circling around the\ninternal idea that a Canadian reference product must be used\, and the\ninsistence that Apotex must prove the impossible __ identicality__\n(reasons\, paragraph 95).\nxii.             \nApotex wished to make its Apo-Trazadone submission\na test case about whether a non-Canadian drug product could be used as a\nreference. __In no way was Apotex the victim that it\npurports to be__ (reasons\, paragraphs 105\, 107).\nxiii.           \nWhile the words __careless\nand unconcerned about accuracy__ could be applied to the testimony of Mr.\nRowsell\, the then Director of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical Surveillance\, all of\nthe remaining fact witnesses called on behalf of the Health Protection Branch __tried their best to be honest\, but somewhat embarrassed\,\nabout the facts and evidence as to what went on some twenty to twenty-eight\nyears ago__ (reasons\, paragraph 106).\nxiv.           \nThe Health Protection Branch __was inefficient\, hopelessly bureaucratic\, dissembling and clumsy__\n(reasons\, paragraph 108).\n[38]          \nThe Federal Court went on to conclude that\nofficials of the Health Protection Branch committed the tort of misfeasance in a\npublic office. Officials were aware\, since the date of the settlement\nagreement\, that the Branch was to consider Apotex__ submission on the basis of\nequivalency - yet the Branch ignored this requirement. Further\, there was an\neffort to conceal this from Apotex. This constituted bad faith. Further\, the\nHealth Protection Branch was aware that its conduct would likely injure Apotex\n(reasons\, paragraphs 117-119).\n[39]          \nNext\, the Federal Court considered the tort of\nnegligence. It found that the settlement agreement transformed the relationship\nbetween the Health Protection Branch and Apotex such that the Branch owed\nApotex a duty of care. But for the settlement agreement\, no duty of care would\nhave been owed to Apotex. The Federal Court further found that no residual\npolicy concerns\, particularly concerns about indeterminate liability and the\ndiscretionary nature of the Branch__s decisions\, negated the existence of the duty\nof care. Finally\, the Federal Court found that the actions of the Health\nProtection Branch breached the requisite standard of care. The breach occurred\nwhen officials insisted on assessing Apotex__ submission on the standard of identicality\,\nrather than the agreed-upon standard of equivalency (reasons\, paragraphs\n123-131).\n[40]          \nNext\, the Federal Court determined that Apotex__ claim\nfor breach of contract failed because it was brought outside the applicable six\nyear limitation period. The action was commenced on October 9\, 1998. Thus\, in\norder to be within the limitation period any breach of contract must have taken\nplace after October 9\, 1992. However\, the Federal Court found that by April or\nJuly 1991\, Apotex was aware of\, and possessed knowledge of\, sufficient facts to\nbe aware that the Branch had breached the terms of the settlement agreement. Thus\,\nthe action was commenced outside the applicable limitation period (reasons\,\nparagraphs 136-138).\n[41]          \nFinally\, the Federal Court considered the issue\nof mitigation. The Federal Court first considered when Apotex__ damages began to\naccrue. The Federal Court inferred that Apotex ought to have received its\nnotice of compliance on November 26\, 1991\, one year after the settlement\nagreement was entered into. Therefore the Court found that Apotex__ damages\nbegan to accrue as of that date.\n[42]          \nThe Federal Court went on to conclude that Apotex__\ndamages ought to be reduced because it did not take reasonable steps to avoid\nits loss. Specifically\, the Federal Court found that a reasonable person would\nhave taken steps to mitigate their damages by July 2\, 1991. This was the date\non which the Federal Court found that Apotex wrote to the Health Protection\nBranch advising that it would mitigate its damages for another drug (Apo-Zidovudine)\nby testing that drug against a Canadian reference product. As of that date\,\nApotex should have re-tested Apo-Trazadone using a Canadian reference standard.\nHad it done so\, Apotex __may have received__ its\nnotice of compliance between 15 to 18 months later. It followed that in\nassessing damages\, the starting date was November 26\, 1991\, but the termination\ndate was mid-November 1992 (reasons\, paragraphs 147-163).\nIII.            \nStandard of Review\n[43]          \nThe standards of review applicable to the issues\nraised on these appeals are as described by the Supreme Court in Housen v.\nNikolaisen\, 2002 SCC 33\, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. The standard of review to be\napplied to questions of law is correctness. Findings of fact and inferences of\nfact are to be reviewed on the basis of palpable and overriding error. Findings\nof mixed fact and law are to be reviewed on the same deferential standard\nunless an extricable legal error can be demonstrated\, in which event such error\nis reviewed on the correctness standard.\nIV.            \nMisfeasance in a Public Office\n[44]          \nI begin by setting out the legal principles\nrelevant to the tort of misfeasance and then turn to the errors asserted by both\nApotex and Health Canada.\nA.               \nThe tort of misfeasance in a public office\n[45]          \nAs neither party asserts any error in the\nFederal Court__s articulation of the elements of this tort\, as set out at\nparagraph 113 of its reasons\, a brief description of the constituent elements\nof the tort is sufficient.\n[46]          \nThe leading authority in Canada is Odhavji\nEstate v. Woodhouse\, 2003 SCC 69\, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263. The Supreme\nCourt explained that the tort is based on the rationale that the rule of law\nrequires that executive or administrative powers ____may\nbe exercised only for the public good__ and not for ulterior and improper\npurposes__ (paragraph 26).\n[47]          \nThere are two constituent elements to the tort.\nFirst\, there must be deliberate\, unlawful conduct in the exercise of public\nfunctions. Second\, there must be awareness on the part of the official that his\nor her conduct is unlawful and is likely to injure the plaintiff (paragraph\n32). The requirement that the official must be aware that his or her conduct is\nunlawful is a reflection of the principle that misfeasance in a public office\nrequires an element of b",aboriginalFederal Court of Appeal Decisions,Aboriginal Voices Radio Inc. v.

This is an appeal from the decision of the\nCommission. This appeal proceeds pursuant to the Court__s order of August 21\,\n2015 granting leave to appeal the decision.\n[2]              \nThe appeal was set for hearing on November 8\,\n2016\, by order dated August 16\, 2016. Thereafter\, by order dated October 3\,\n2016\, counsel for Aboriginal Voices was permitted to withdraw. On November 4\,\n2016\, the Chairman of Aboriginal Voices wrote to the Court asking for an\nadjournment of the hearing. The letter advised that counsel for Aboriginal\nVoices had resigned due to its __inability to fully pay\ntheir fees at this time.__ The adjournment was requested on the basis\nthat Aboriginal Voices __is currently underway with a\nfundraising effort for legal fees\, which we feel will be successful given more\ntime.__\n[3]              \nAt the commencement of the hearing on November\n8\, 2016\, the Chairman of Aboriginal Voices made oral submissions in support of\nthe requested adjournment. The Attorney General opposed this request and filed\naffidavit evidence. After hearing counsel for the Attorney General and the\nChairman of Aboriginal Voices in reply\, we briefly reserved our decision. After\nconsidering the request for an adjournment\, we advised the parties that the\nadjournment was denied for reasons to be delivered later. Those reasons follow.\n[4]              \nFirst\, the jurisprudence is to the effect that\nparties with a fixed hearing date will receive an adjournment only in\nexceptional circumstances.\n[5]              \nSecond\, the adjournment was sought for an\nunlimited period on the basis of an unspecified fundraising effort to raise\nfunds for legal fees. This is of particular concern in circumstances when the\nCommission in the decision under review noted that Aboriginal Voices__ financial\nviability had been of recurring concern to the Commission (reasons\, at\nparagraph 63) and found a new business plan submitted by Aboriginal Voices __does not include the type and level of detail necessary to\nconvince the Commission of its viability__ (reasons\, at paragraph 67).\n[6]              \nMost importantly\, in the decision under review\,\nthe Commission noted the __pressing need to serve the\nAboriginal community as a whole given that issues vitally important to\nAboriginal Canadians are not fully covered or addressed at all in non-Native\nmedia.__ Thus\, the Commission indicated that as a matter of priority it\nintended to __issue a call for applications and hold a\nhearing to license new services that would fulfill this mandate__\n(reasons\, at paragraph 86).\n[7]              \nThereafter\, by order dated August 21\, 2015\, this\nCourt stayed the decision of the Commission revoking the licenses on terms that\nthe parties strictly adhere to the timelines set out in the Federal Courts Rules.\n[8]              \nThe evidence tendered by the Attorney General is\nnot challenged by Aboriginal Voices. It is to the effect that:\ni.                   \nAboriginal Voices__ radio stations in Ottawa\,\nCalgary and Edmonton are not currently broadcasting.\nii.                 \nWhile Aboriginal Voices__ station in Toronto is\noperational\, the station in Vancouver is only intermittently active.\niii.               \nWhile acknowledging this Court__s order staying\nits decision\, the Commission has issued a call for applications for services.\niv.               \nThe Commission has received twelve proposals\nfrom five organizations to operate radio stations serving indigenous\ncommunities in Vancouver\, Calgary\, Edmonton\, Toronto and Ottawa.\nv.                 \nThese applications will not be considered until\nthis Court makes a final determination of this appeal.\n[9]              \nIn these circumstances\, we were satisfied the\ninterests of justice did not favour granting the requested adjournment.\n[10]          \nAfter advising the parties that the adjournment\nwould not be granted\, we offered Aboriginal Voices the opportunity to address\noral submissions to us\, or the opportunity to have the appeal decided on the\nbasis of the memoranda of fact and law filed by counsel for the parties.\nAboriginal Voices selected the second alternative.\n[11]          \nI therefore turn to the merits of the appeal on\nthe basis of the written record.\n[12]          \nOn this appeal Aboriginal Voices asserts a\nnumber of errors on the part of the Commission. For the following reasons I am\nof the view that the Commission did not err as alleged.\n[13]          \nTo begin\, contrary to the submission of\nAboriginal Voices\, the Commission adequately considered the extent to which the\nCommission__s Native Radio Policy affected Aboriginal Voices. Thus\, at paragraph\n58 of its reasons\, the Commission acknowledged the licensee__s argument based on\n__the constraints associated with having to operate as a\nnot-for-profit organization pursuant to the Native Radio Policy__. After\nacknowledging this argument the Commission went on to reject it\, noting that\nAboriginal Voices Radio __was not allocating sufficient\nresources to vital elements such as programming and sales and marketing__:\n59.       Similar explanations were provided\nby the licensee at each of the previous three renewal hearings. In the last\nrenewal decision\, the Commission specifically stated that it was concerned that\nAVR was not allocating sufficient resources to vital elements such as\nprogramming and sales and marketing\, adding that it considered that an\neffective allocation of AVR__s limited resources would be critical if it was to\novercome its financial challenges.\n60.       Notwithstanding these admonitions\,\nin the current licence term AVR laid off almost all of its sales and\nprogramming staff in 2014. Of the remaining five staff members\, four were\nexecutives. By its own admission\, these remaining staff members were focused on\nlarger questions of financial viability rather than ensuring regulatory\ncompliance. As a case in point\, in explaining how AVR could be unaware that its\nstations in Edmonton and Calgary had gone off-air\, the licensee stated: __We\nweren__t necessarily focused on\, you know\, monitoring the station every day simply\nbecause we did not have the personnel to do that and we were trying to\nreinvigorate AVR as an operation.__\n[14]          \nMoreover\, the Commission was not required to\ndeal more comprehensively with this submission because during the hearing\nAboriginal Voices abandoned its request to be exempted from the Native Radio\nPolicy. Aboriginal Voices clarified to the Commission that its business plan\nwas not contingent on receiving such an exemption (see paragraph 93 of the CRTC\nhearing transcript).\n[15]          \nNext\, Aboriginal Voices argues that the\nCommission failed to fairly and adequately consider the proposed business plan it\npresented.\n[16]          \nThis submission is without merit. At paragraph\n15 of its decision the Commission noted that at the outset of the hearing it\nhad stated its intent to consider\, among other things\, __the\nviability of [Aboriginal Voices Radio__s] business plan__. Thereafter at\nparagraphs 66 to 68 and at paragraph 73 the Commission wrote:\n66.       It is only at the end of the day\non 8 May 2015\, five days before the hearing\, that AVR detailed its strategy to\nincrease revenues in the event of a renewal. The business plan stated that all\nfunding for AVR__s operations would come from advertising revenues. The\nnecessary increase in advertising revenues was predicated on an increase in\ntuning\, which the licensee submitted would be made possible through the\nimplementation of two strategies to improve its position in the radio markets\nit serves\, namely converting to the soft adult contemporary format and offering\n__advertiser-oriented-content\, i.e. content that stands on its own as compelling\ncontent and also serves the marketing needs of the clients.__\n67.       While supported by a consulting\ngroup with extensive experience\, this plan did not include the type and level\nof detail necessary to convince the Commission of its viability. In particular\,\nthe Commission finds that the financial projections filed as part of AVR__s\nbusiness plan are untenable given AVR__s historical financial performance.\nMoreover\, the projected increase in revenues is dependent on an increase in tuning\,\nbut little market research or quantitative evidence was provided to substantiate\nthe projected increase in tuning.\n68.       More fundamentally\, however\, the\nplan was still a plan. At the hearing\, AVR spoke of the types of advertisers it\nplanned to approach\, as well as the type of advertising spots (primarily\nadvertiser-oriented content) that it intended to pursue. However\, AVR could not\nprovide concrete examples of advertisers who had agreed to purchase advertising\ntime on the stations. In fact\, AVR stated that it had not yet put together\npresentations to approach advertisers because of the uncertainty surrounding\nits licensing status. In its description of its business plan\, AVR consistently\nused expressions such as __developing__\, __being put into place__\, __relatively new__\nand __putting together.__\n__\n73.       Moreover\, AVR__s attitude during\nthis renewal process does not provide the Commission with confidence that the\nlicensee understands or can deliver on its mandate as a Native Type B radio\nstation with a focus on serving the Aboriginal communities in its urban\nmarkets. For example\, Bray__s business plan proposed to remove the word\nAboriginal from the branding of the stations and to focus on a soft adult\ncontemporary music format with a target audience aged 35-64 and a female skew.\nWhile AVR argued that this format works well with the Aboriginal music and\ncultural programming it broadcasts\, it is telling that its stated target\naudience is female rather than Aboriginal.\n[17]          \nAboriginal Voices next argues that the\nCommission considered an irrelevant factor in reaching its decision: the\nCommission__s interpretation of what constitutes programming of __direct and particular relevance to the Aboriginal community__.\n[18]          \nAgain\, I respectfully disagree. At paragraph 42\nof its decision the Commission made reference to evidence from a representative\nof the Canadian Association of Aboriginal Broadcasters as to what constitutes\ncontent __of direct and particular relevance__ to\nurban Aboriginal communities. This evidence is consistent with Aboriginal\nVoices__ license application in respect of its Edmonton station in which it\nstated that __[n]ews stories selection will focus on\nevents which impact Canada__s urban Aboriginal communities that have been\noverlooked and under reported by other news sources__. Implicit in the\nreasons of the Commission is the acceptance of this evidence.\n[19]          \nIn any event\, at paragraph 43 of its reasons\,\nthe Commission noted that even if one accepted the position of Aboriginal\nVoices with respect to what constitutes a news story of direct and particular\nrelevance to the Aboriginal community\, Aboriginal Voices did not air five\ndistinct local news stories on May 29\, 2014 as required by a condition of its\nlicense. At the end of the day the Commission was not satisfied that Aboriginal\nVoices had demonstrated that it provided a uniquely Aboriginal viewpoint and\nreported stories of direct and particular relevance to Aboriginal Canadians\n(reasons\, at paragraph 44).\n[20]          \nAboriginal Voices also argues that the\nCommission breached its duty of procedural fairness by departing from Aboriginal\nVoices__ legitimate expectation that the Commission would follow its practice of\ngraduated escalation of regulatory measures. However\, the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectations relates to procedural entitlements in administrative\ndecision-making. It does not provide substantive relief.\n[21]          \nParagraph 9(1)(e) of the Broadcasting\nAct\, S.C. 1991\, c. 11 grants broad authority to the Commission to __suspend or revoke any license__. The doctrine of\nlegitimate expectations cannot act to fetter or restrict the power conferred on\nthe Commission to revoke a broadcasting license.\n[22]          \nFinally\, Aboriginal Voices submits that the\nCommission failed to provide adequate reasons why all five licenses were\nrevoked. Again\, I reject this contention. Each of the radio stations operated\nby Aboriginal Voices were found to be noncompliant with the following license\nconditions:\ni.                   \nThe obligation to file program logs and logger\ntapes pursuant to subsections 8(4) and 8(6) of the Radio Regulations\, 1986\n(Regulations) (reasons\, at paragraphs 22-26);\nii.                 \nThe obligation to file annual returns pursuant\nto subsection 9(2) of the Regulations (reasons\, at paragraphs 27-30);\niii.               \nThe obligation to respond to requests for\ninformation from the Commission regarding Aboriginal Voices__ adherence to the\nconditions of its license\, the Broadcasting Act\, and the Regulations as\nrequired by paragraph 9(4)(b) of the Regulations (reasons\, at paragraphs\n31-35);\niv.               \nThe obligation to file annual updates setting\nout how Aboriginal Voices was achieving its business objectives for each market\nas required by condition of license 9 (reasons\, at paragraphs 46-50); and\,\nv.                 \nThe obligation to file audited financial\nstatements for each of the five radio stations operated by Aboriginal Voices as\nrequired by condition of license 10 (reasons\, at paragraph 51-57).\n[23]          \nIt follows that I would dismiss the appeal with\ncosts.\n__Eleanor R.

Background\n \n[2]              \nThe\nApplicant is a citizen of Philippines who came to Canada in October\n2001 under the Live in Caregiver program\, a prescribed class. However\, because\nshe did not work for the minimum two years as a Live in Caregiver during the\nthree-year term of her visa\, she did not qualify for a permanent residency visa\nunder paragraph 113(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection\nRegulations\, S.O.R./2002-227 (the Regulations). She then made a refugee\nclaim which was denied. In December 2006 she made her H&C Application which\nis the basis for this Judicial Review.\n \n[3]              \nThe\nApplicant has three children. Her oldest child\, a boy\, is a citizen of the Philippines and resides\nthere with his grandparents although the Applicant provides financial support.\nThe Applicant also has two children\, both girls\, born in Canada and hence\nare Canadian citizens. The older of these two children was born in September\n2003 and the younger was born in November 2005. The Applicant is the sole\ncaregiver and provider for these two children. \n \n[4]              \nThe\nApplicant had been in a common-law relationship in Canada. However\,\nher partner abused her verbally\, physically and mentally. Initially\, the\nApplicant was afraid to leave her partner or complain as she feared she would\nbe deported if the police became involved. After she finally told the police on\nMarch 23\, 2005\, her partner was charged and subsequently pleaded guilty to two\ncounts of assault. He was sentenced to one day imprisonment and one year\nprobation. He was also forbidden to communicate with the Applicant or to be\nnear her. He has not had provided any support to the Applicant__s children and\nhas refused to recognize the two younger children as his own.\n \n[5]              \nThe\nApplicant has been employed as a building administrator since May 2006. From\nthis income\, she provides for herself and her Canadian-born children as well as\nsending money to support her son in Philippines. The Applicant claims\nthat if she is sent back to the Philippines she will be unable to\nearn enough money to support her family. She says that her relatives there are\nnot able to support her and that single mothers in the Philippines are\nparticularly vulnerable due to human rights abuses\, high crime and limited\nemployment opportunities.\n \n[6]              \nOn\nJune 20\, 2007\, the Immigration Officer made the Decision which denied the\nApplicant__s H&C Application. In the reasons supporting the Decision\, the Immigration\nOfficer noted that the Applicant had no family ties in Canada other than her\ntwo daughters and that her degree of establishment in Canada is nothing\nbeyond the normal establishment that one would expect under the circumstances.\n \n[7]              \nThe\nImmigration Officer also considered the best interest of the children:\n[The Applicant] has one son in the Philippines and 2 children born in Canada. Counsel has made arguments\nstating the best interest of the Canadian born children would be met if the\nmother was to remain in Canada. Counsel has noted separation\nbetween the children and their mother should she decides to leave them in Canada and the resulting hardship it\nwould be for the family. I note the children will retain their Canadian\ncitizenship regardless of where they reside. I note the children are 3 _ and 1\n_ young enough that the hardships associated with relocation to another country\nwill be minimal. With respect to separation between the mother and children\, I\nfind this is a decision left to the applicant should she decide to leave her\nchildren in Canada. Although children residing\nin Canada may enjoy better social and economic opportunities than they would in\nthe Philippines\, there is little evidence before me to suggest these children\ncannot attend school or be allowed legal entry in the Philippines.\n \n[8]              \nFurthermore\,\nthe Immigration Officer discussed the Applicant__s prospects if she was\nreturned:\nI also noted the applicant__s extended\nfamily members particularly father\, mother live in the Philippines. [The Applicant] worked in her country\nas an insurance coordinator for a number of years. It would be reasonable to\nexpect that with the skills acquired in Canada she can find similar type of\nemployment in the Philippines.\n \nI now turn to the economic situation in\nthe Philippines. I recognize that social and\neconomic conditions in the Philippines may not be favorable\, but\nthey are a common factor that affects the general population as a whole.\n \nII. Issues and standard\nof review\n \n[9]              \nThe\nApplicant submits that the Immigration Officer erred by failing to properly\nassess the best interest of the Applicant__s children. The Applicant also argues\nthat the Immigration Officer erred in her assessment of the Applicant__s establishment\nand integration into Canadian society. The Supreme Court of Canada determined\nin Baker v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 that the standard of\nreview for H&C decisions is reasonableness simpliciter. \n \n\n\nIII. Analysis\n \nA.         \nBest interests of the child\n[10]          \nThe\nApplicant submits that the Immigration Officer was not alive\, alert and\nsensitive to the children__s best interests. I disagree. The Immigration Officer\naccepted without challenge the hardship of separation if the children stayed in\nCanada and then\nwent on to consider the hardship of accompanying their mother to Philippines. The\nImmigration Officer did not need to discuss at length the hardship of\nseparation especially given the limited evidence provided by the Applicant. The\nImmigration Officer __may be presumed to know that living in Canada can offer a\nchild many opportunities and that\, as a general rule\, a child living in Canada\nwith her parent is better off than a child living in Canada without her parent__\n(Hawthorne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\, 2002 FCA\n475 at para. 5).\n \n[11]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer did focus on the hardships the children would suffer if\nthey accompanied their mother to the Philippines. In my view\, the\nImmigration Officer could reasonably rely on the young age of the children and\nconclude that pre-school children could adapt without great difficulty. The\nApplicant did not submit any evidence that would contradict this finding\,\nincluding evidence that the children would not be admitted to the Philippines or be able\nto attend school there.\n \n[12]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer rightly accepted that the family\, including the children\,\nwould face social and economic hardships in the Philippines. However\,\nthe Applicant__s own evidence was that she had worked as an insurance\ncoordinator in the Philippines and so it was reasonable to conclude that she\nwould be able to find work there. In addition\, the Immigration Officer\nreasonably took note of the fact that the Applicant__s extended family\n(including her parents who were already caring for her son) were in the Philippines. \n \n[13]          \nThere\nis no issue that the Immigration Officer accepted there would be hardship. The\nquestion was whether the hardship was sufficient to justify an exemption under\nhumanitarian and compassionate considerations. This is a weighing of evidence\nbest left to the Immigration Officer and I see no reason to overturn the\nDecision on that basis.\n \nB.         \nApplicant's Establishment and Integration in Canada\n[14]          \nThe\nImmigration Officer concluded that __the degree of establishment is nothing\nbeyond the normal establishment that one would expect the applicant to have\naccomplished in the circumstances__ and that there is nothing to suggest that\nshe would suffer unusual\, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if those ties\nwere severed. \n \n[15]          \nThe\nApplicant argues that the Immigration officer did not consider the appropriate\nfactors to determine the degree of establishment\, as proposed by Justice Pierre\nBlais in Jamrich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2003)\,\n29 Imm. L.R. (3d) 253\, 2003 FCT 804\, (see also Raudales v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2003 FCT 385. The Respondent submits that\nthe usual criteria were applied here.\n \n[16]          \nIn\nmy view\, there is no error in the Immigration offcier__s conclusions. As noted\nin relatively recent decisions such as Ruiz v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2006 FC 465 and Lee v. Canada (Minister of\nCitizenship and Immigration)\, 2005 FC 413\, the fact that\nthere is some degree of establishment is not sufficient. The Immigration\nOfficer considered the evidence the Applicant put forward and weighed it.\nWhether or not I agree with the Decision\, it is reasonable and thus should\nstand. \n \n\n\nJUDGMENT\nTHIS COURT\nORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the application\nfor judicial review is dismissed.\n \n \n""Orville\nFrenette""\n\nDeputy Judge\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL COURT\n \nNAME OF COUNSEL AND SOLICITORS OF RECORD\n \n \n \nDOCKET:                                          IMM-2643-07\n \nSTYLE OF CAUSE:                          ENRIQUETA\nRAMOS TARAYAO  \n                                                                                                               \n\nand\n \nTHE MINISTER OF\nCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION   \n                                                                                                              \n\n \nPLACE OF HEARING:                    Toronto\, Ontario\n \nDATE OF HEARING:                      MARCH 11\, 2008\n \nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT\nAND JUDGMENT BY:                    FRENETTE\, DEPUTY JUDGE.\n \nDATED:                                             March 17\, 2008           \n \n \n \nAPPEARANCES:\n \nMs. Krassina\nKostadinov                                                           FOR APPLICANT\n \nMs. Amina Riaz                                                                        FOR\nRESPONDENT\n \n \nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD:\n \nWaldman &\nAssociates\nBarrister &\nSolicitor\nToronto\,\n Ontario                                                                      FOR\nAPPLICANT\n \nJohn H.

The claim reveals that the plaintiffs include the M_tis National Council of Women (""MNCW"") a non-profit organization representing some M_tis women. It has 11 objects including: ""to actively seek funding for the organization and its projects and activities"".\n[2]      The MNCW also has a mandate which includes: ""to promote and enhance the well-being of M_tis women and families"". The claim also states that the MNCW is the:\n\n \nonly national Aboriginal organization that has as its primary purpose the representation of the interests of all M_tis women in Canada\, regardless of whether they live on or off settlements\, in urban or rural areas\, in Qu_bec or other provinces\, with regard to all the unique issues posed by both the agenda and their M_tis heritage.\n\n \nThe claim also states that the MNCW ""is an independent and autonomous organization not affiliated with or related to the M_tis National Council (""MNC"") in any formal or organization manner. The MNC is governed by a council predominantly made up of men.""\n[3]      The plaintiffs also include Sheila D. Genaille (""Genaille"") a seventh generation M_tis alleged to have a personal and direct interest in the matter set out in the claim. As president of MNCW she has been actively attempting to obtain job training and creation funding for M_tis women.\n[4]      The plaintiffs also include Joyce Gus (""Gus"") another individual plaintiff\, and third generation M_tis\, and Doreen Fleury (""Fleury"") a seventh generation M_tis\, both of whom have been active in the struggle for M_tis women""s rights and have been active in attempting to obtain job training and creation funding for M_tis women\, and have made numerous unsuccessful applications to the Federal Government through the Pathways to Success Program for Aboriginal job training and employment and under the new structured Aboriginal Employment Program for job training and creation funding in order to participate in the allocation of funding to projects that will benefit M_tis women\, in order to obtain funding that can be translated into job training\, educational and employment opportunities for native women\, in order to gain the experience in the administration of such programs in order to help fund employment for themselves as M_tis women\, in order to increase resources available to deal with social\, community\, and relationship issues of particular concern to native women by virtue of their gender and their M_tis heritage\, and in order to deliver job training and creation programs to M_tis women.\n[5]      Having perhaps oversimplified the qualifications of the plaintiffs\, I will\, subject to a similar possibility\, attempt to simplify the situation giving rise to the action as follows.\n[6]      The Ottawa government decided to do something about the unemployment of Aboriginal people. For this purpose it nominated a committee composed of members of various organizations namely\, Assembly of First Nations (""AFN"")\, Inuit Trapirisat Canada (""ITC"")\, M_tis National Council (""MNC"")\, Native Women""s Association of Canada (""NWAC"")\, National Association of Friendship Centres (""NAFC"")\, Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (""CAP""). The function of the committee was to advise the government with regard to government spending intended to provide jobs and job training for Aboriginal people. At that time the corporate plaintiff did not exist.\n[7]      A scheme was devised and the government disbursed money for the purposes settled upon with the committee. The government then decided to delegate the actual allocation of funds to certain organizations being three of those from whom the members of the committee had come. The corporate plaintiff was by then in existence\, but it was not asked to allocate any of the monies.\n[8]      The three organizations\, which at first were allowed to allocate funds to spend\, were those of the First Nations\, the Inuit and the M_tis National Organization\, which entered into agreements with the government to distribute $200 million each through their regional organizations. The distribution system was to be devised to be inclusive of the objectives of the other three groups which originally participated in the committee but were not recipients directly of the $600 million provided to the three national organizations.\n[9]      It appears these objectives of inclusivity were not achieved and a further $20 million was provided to the three other organizations (NWAC\, NAFC and CAP) represented on the original committee\, non-participants in the $600 million. The $20 million was not made available to the regional subdivisions of these three additional groups. One of the three splitting the $20 million was the Native Women""s Association of Canada.\n[10]      None of the organizations allows participation in the allocation of funds by the corporate plaintiff. The alleged discrimination against M_tis women\, it is alleged\, is perpetuated by the employment and training program because it authorizes M_tis organizations and women""s organizations other than the corporate plaintiff and its affiliates to administer the program.\n[11]      The relief sought is six interim and permanent declarations and an injunction. The plaintiff also asks the Court to read into the 1997-98 or 1998-99 Regional Bilateral Agreements six terms requiring equality between men and women\, equality between M_tis men and M_tis women\, the appointment of M_tis women representatives on each administrative board\, equality between M_tis living in M_tis communities and M_tis not so living\, that jobs will be created equally for men and women in and outside M_tis communities\, and also requiring reading into the 1998-99 agreement that the MNCW is a signatory.\n[12]      The defendant seeks to have the claim struck on the grounds that this Court has no jurisdiction to dispose of an action seeking declarative or injunctive relief which is only available by the judicial review procedure as described by s. 18(3) of the Federal Court Act.\n[13]      The plaintiff states in response that the action is for declaratory relief and orders that the defendant has breached its common-law fiduciary obligations to the plaintiffs as Aboriginal persons and has violated the plaintiffs"" rights under sections 15 and 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \, and has violated the plaintiffs"" Aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act . The plaintiff argues that the Court""s jurisdiction arises in statutory law\, common law and constitutional law\, namely s.17(1) and s.48 of the Federal Court Act \, Her Majesty the Queen""s fiduciary obligations to Aboriginal people\, and section 15\, 28\, and 24(1)\, of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and sections 35 and 52 of the Constitution Act\, 1982.\n[14]      The plaintiffs further submit that the defendant in this action is clearly not a federal board\, commission or tribunal and that therefore sections 18 and 18.1 of the Act have no application to the action. The plaintiffs particularly argue that s. 48 provides jurisdiction as does s. 17(1) of the Federal Court Act. They point out that Her Majesty the Queen is not a federal board\, commission or other tribunal as defined in s. 2 of Federal Court Act\, and the Crown cannot be named in a judicial review proceeding.\n[15]      The plaintiffs also state that they seek a finding that the defendant has fiduciary obligations to them as Aboriginal persons and has breached said fiduciary obligations. The plaintiff further argues that s. 24(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms form an independent basis upon which the Court can order declaratory relief as sought by the plaintiffs in their amended statement of claim.\n[16]      In reply the defendant Crown states that the plaintiffs"" challenge is to various administrative decisions made in 1995 pursuant to statutory authority to provide money for employment and training for Aboriginals. The plaintiffs are not challenging the constitutionality of the legislation pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act\, 1982 \, but are challenging decisions made under that statutory authority. The defendant further argues that s. 48 does not confer jurisdiction; it only sets out how to serve and file claims for which the Court already has jurisdiction.\n[17]      The plaintiffs argue that the decision of a Minister or Ministers to enter bilateral agreements to transfer funds and devolve employment training programs directly to Aboriginals are strictly contractual agreements between the Aboriginal organizations and the federal government and involved the administration\, fiscal responsibility and management of federal human resources.\n[18]      The plaintiff argues that s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act\, 1982 has elevated unextinguished Aboriginal rights that existed before 1982 to constitutional status. The plaintiff argues that violations of Aboriginal rights recognized by s. 35(1) can be remedied under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act\, and that declaratory relief is one of the remedial options open to the Courts under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act. The plaintiff argues that the Courts will grant declaratory relief under s. 52(1) for violations of the Crown""s fiduciary obligations to Aboriginal persons as well as for failure to engage in meaningful consultation and negotiation.\n[19]      In reply\, the defendant states that the plaintiffs are M_tis women who claim to have been denied access to the negotiation\, administration and establishment of certain federal funding programs for the employment and training of Aboriginal people from 1997 to 1999. The defendant argues that the challenge is to the administrative decisions largely made in 1995 pursuant to statutory authority to provide monies for the employment and training of Aboriginal peoples and that such challenge should have been brought by way of judicial review of the federal administrative actions because the plaintiffs are challenging only the administrative decisions and not the constitutionality of the enabling legislation itself.\n[20]      The defendant claims that s. 48 is merely a procedural provision and does not provide an independent source of jurisdiction. The defendant submits that the plaintiffs claim challenges the administrative decisions by the Minister of Human Resource Development and the Secretary of State for Youth in 1995 (four years ago) to sign national funding agreements with MNC\, NWAC\, AFN\, NAFC\, ITC and CAP\, and the regional units of MNC\, AFN and ITC being organizations other than MNCW or M_tis women""s groups to deliver job creation and training for Aboriginal peoples.\n[21]      The defendant further submits that when the Minister and the Commission made the impugned decisions to implement changes to the funding of such programs\, to negotiate agreements with certain Aboriginal organizations and to allegedly refuse to negotiate with or grant the defendants funding\, each were exercising delegated authority pursuant to valid federal legislation\, which itself is not challenged herein. These organizations were therefore acting as a federal board commission or other tribunal within the meaning of s. 18. Accordingly\, as a challenge to administrative action the plaintiffs concerns ought to have been launched as an application for judicial review under s. 18. Instead\, the plaintiffs have filed an action seeking declarations pursuant to s. 17 and s. 48 of the Federal Court Act and have relied on case law which developed in the context of challenges to federal laws not administrative actions. The defendant goes on and states that the plaintiffs are not challenging any federal law or regulation\, instead they challenge various administrative decisions made by officials acting pursuant to statutory authority namely\, the Annual Appropriation Acts and the Unemployment Insurance Act.\n[22]      In summary\, they argue that what is impugned is not the specific piece of legislation but the manner in which a federal program of government funding is being administered\, all of which the defendant states supports the argument that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action although it might have had to entertain an application for judicial review.\n[23]      The fiduciary duties of the Crown to Aboriginal peoples which it is alleged have not been carried out have not been particularized but\, whatever they are\, they presumably arise from the manner in which the various schemes outlined in the claim for the allocation of money for the provision of employment and training services to Aboriginals have been carried out or not carried out.\n[24]      Money does not allocate itself and operations do not ""just happen"". Anything involving money done by the Government is done because it is authorized by legislation and regulations made thereunder. The legislation is enacted by the Sovereign in Parliament\, and if the legislation is impugned the proper defendant is the Sovereign. However\, in this case it is stated that the legislation is not impugned.\n[25]      Given that an action is permitted or ordered by the legislation\, the action will almost invariably be taken\, or not\, by a federal board\, commission or other tribunal which terms are defined to include any body\, any person or persons having or exercising or purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers\, etc. This is in brief who does\, or being empowered to does not\, do anything with respect to Aboriginals. The plaintiffs"" counsel states\, in effect\, that the plaintiffs are seeking relief against the Crown for breaking its fiduciary obligation to Aboriginal women. From the relief claimed and the sections of the Constitution relied on\, it is apparent that what is being complained of with regard to fiduciary obligations is that the plaintiffs have not been given the same as was given to other Aboriginal organizations. The ""gift"" to others and thus the complaint was at the level of the framework agreements which were made at the federal board level and not the Crown level. Thus\, in seeking declarations that the plaintiffs should have been beneficiaries of or should have been allowed to allocate some of the expenditures authorized for Aboriginals for employment or training\, the plaintiffs are seeking declaratory relief and they are not seeking it against the Crown in parliament for passing the legislation but are seeking it against a federal board for not including them in the board""s schemes which\, as is provided by s.18(3) may be obtained on an application for judicial review made under s.18.1. That is to say\, not by an action.\n[26]      The statement of claim will therefore be struck out. With regard to the possibility of converting to an application\, it is provided in section 18.1(2) that an application for judicial review shall be made within 30 days after the time the decision or order was first communicated to the party directly affected thereby or within such further time as a Judge of the Trial Division may fix or allow. It being patent that 30 days has expired\, a motion for extension would obviously be required before an application for judicial review could be filed.\n                                  ""Peter A.

In the\nalternative\, they are asking the Court to exercise its discretion pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(b)\nof the Federal Courts Act\, RSC 1985\, c F-7 (FCA) and to stay the proceeding\nin the interests of justice\, or essentially to encourage the plaintiffs to assert\ntheir rights before the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n[2]              \nThe plaintiffs\, all Innu of Quebec\, are\nchallenging the motion and are essentially arguing that their action\, which applies\nonly to the federal Crown\, concerns the negotiation and the entering into\, in violation\nof their Aboriginal and treaty rights\, of an agreement__in__principle\nbetween the federal Crown\, the Government of NFL and the Innu of Labrador\, namely\nto recognize the rights of the Innu of Labrador in Labrador.\n[3]              \nAt the hearing before the Court\, the position of\nthe plaintiffs was further clarified: because the plaintiffs are simply seeking\nto have the federal Crown__s constitutional duty to consult them and accommodate\nthem recognized\, this Court has the jurisdiction to hear and dispose of their\naction.\n[4]              \nFor the following reasons\, the motions to strike\nof the defendant and the intervener will be granted and the plaintiffs__ action\nwill be stayed pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(b) of the FCA. \nII.               \nThe facts\n[5]              \nThe plaintiffs claim to be the descendants of\nthe Innu bands that historically occupied and used the Nitassian__Labrador land for\nsubsistence purposes\, by practicing their unique way of life based on hunting\,\nfishing\, trapping and gathering.\n[6]              \nIn paragraph 24 of their statement of claim\,\nthey thus describe the activities that are integral to their distinctive\nculture and\, hence\, their Aboriginal rights:\n[translation]\n(a)        Hunting\, fishing\, trapping and gathering activities\,\nincluding the harvesting of wildlife such as hunting caribou\, moose and\npartridge for subsistence\, cultural\, social\, ritualistic and commercial\npurposes;\n(b)       The harvesting of plant\, water\, mineral and timber\nresources for subsistence\, cultural\, social\, ritualistic and commercial\npurposes; \n(c)        The construction of camps\, caches\, residences or other\nfacilities necessary to their way of life and to the pursuit of their\ntraditional activities;\n(d)       The use of land\, including watercourses\, to exercise their\ntraditional activities\, such as harvesting\, as well as for transportation\npurposes;\n(e)        The exercise of their spiritual and\ncultural practices.\n[7]              \nThe plaintiffs allege that they have been exercising\ntheir traditional activities on Nitassinan__Labrador land since before the\narrival of the Europeans and well before the establishment of the provincial\nQuebec__NFL border and NFL__s entrance into the Canadian federation.\n[8]              \nIn November 2011\, the Government of Canada\, the\nGovernment of NFL and the Innu of Labrador signed an agreement-in-principle\nconcerning Labrador Innu land claims and self__government. Part 2.1 of the\nAgreement-in-Principle reads as follows:\n2.1.1 - The Agreement-in-Principle does not\ncreate legal obligations binding on the Parties and does not define\, create\,\nrecognize\, abrogate\, derogate\, deny or amend any of the rights of the Parties.\n2.1.2 - The Agreement-in-Principle shall form\nthe basis for concluding the Agreement [which is defined under 1.1.1 as being\nthe Labrador Innu final land claims settlement agreement] and the Parties agree\nto begin to negotiate the Agreement in good faith as soon as possible following\nthe signing of the Agreement__in__Principle.\n[9]              \nThe plaintiffs are criticizing the federal Crown\nfor not having consulted them before it signed the Agreement-in-Principle\, even\nthough it knew of the potential existence of asserted Aboriginal rights and\nthat the Agreement-in-Principle was likely to have an adverse impact on those\nrights.\n[10]          \nHowever\, it seems that\, instead\, the plaintiffs\nwere consulted in the context of the negotiations for the Agreement-in-Principle.\nThat is at least what is reflected in a letter dated April 1\, 2015\, by the\nAboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada negotiator to the plaintiffs__\nrespective chiefs (the letter was filed by consent at the hearing of the\nmotions). Pages 3 and 4 of the letter state the following: \n[translation]\nWe would like to reiterate that the entire consultation\nprocess will be complete when the groups that have the potential to suffer harm\nfrom a potential treaty with the Innu of Labrador have had the opportunity to\nbe consulted on the draft of the final agreement. For the moment\, as you\nexplained in your letter dated January 15\, 2015\, we understand that\nthe only accommodation that is satisfactory to you would be to put eliminate\nany overlaps and remove all benefits\, advantages or rights of the Labrador Innu\nin areas where you deem that only your communities are impacted.\nTaking all of these elements into\nconsideration\, we find that the time has come to end the consultations for the Agreement__in__Principle\nand to prepare for the consultations for the draft of the final agreement where\nyou may see the changes made by the negotiation table since November 2011. We\nwill contact you before the end of the negotiation of the final agreement to\ninitiate the last phase of the consultation process.\n[11]          \nUnsatisfied with the federal government__s position\,\nthe plaintiffs brought this action\, by which they are seeking\n[translation]\n1.

A declaration that\, under the common law\, treaties\nbetween the French Crown and the British Crown\, on the one hand\, and the Grand Innu\nNation\, on the other\, and various constitutional instruments\, including the Royal Proclamation\nof 1763\, the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada and the\nNewfoundland Act\, the defendant has\, among Her fiduciary and constitutional\nduties\, the duty to recognize\, protect\, respect\, preserve and promote the plaintiffs__\nfreedom and right to exercise without interference their Aboriginal and treaty\nrights in Nitassinan-Labrador.\n9.         A declaration that the defendant contravened the honour\nof the Crown and breached those fiduciary and constitutional duties to\nrecognize\, protect\, respect\, preserve and promote the plaintiffs__ freedom and\nright to exercise without interference their Aboriginal and treaty rights in\nNitassinan__Labrador\, including by signing the Agreement__in-Principle\nand by continuing negotiation of a final agreement\, both without the plaintiffs__\nconsent.\n10.       A permanent injunction ordering the defendant\, Her\nofficers\, directors\, employees\, servants\, agents and those in active concert\nand participation with Her\, (a) to take the necessary measures to prevent or to\nstop any implementation of the Agreement-in-Principle by the defendant\, (b) to fulfill\nHer Majesty__s constitutional and fiduciary duties relating to the plaintiffs in\naccordance with the honour of the Crown and Her Majesty__s constitutional\njurisdiction under subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act\, 1982\,\n(c) to not participate in the negotiations in relation to signing the final agreement\nwithout the plaintiffs__ consent or without having extensively consulted with\nand accommodated the plaintiffs regarding their Aboriginal and treaty rights in\nNitassinan-Labrador\, and (d) to not sign the final agreement without the plaintiffs__\nconsent or without having extensively consulted with and accommodated the plaintiffs\nregarding their Aboriginal and treaty rights in Nitassinan-Labrador.\nIII.            \nIssues\n[12]          \nThe following issues arise in the motions of the\ndefendant and the intervener:\n-                     \nDoes the Federal Court have jurisdiction to\nissue the orders sought by the plaintiffs?\n-                     \nIs it in the interests of justice to stay the\nplaintiffs__ action so that the issues raised by the plaintiffs can be argued\nbefore the Supreme Court of NFL? \nIV.            \nAnalysis\n-                     \nDoes the Federal Court have jurisdiction to\nissue the orders sought by the plaintiffs?\n[13]          \nIn the context of a motion to strike a pleading\,\nthe facts as alleged must be taken as proven. The issue is therefore whether\,\nassuming that the facts can be proven\, it is __plain and\nobvious__ that the plaintiffs__ statement of claim fails to disclose a\nreasonable cause of action (Hunt v Carey Canada Inc\, [1990] 2 SCR 959 at\npara 33). In the case at bar\, the absence of a cause of action would result from\nthe Federal Court__s lack of jurisdiction on the very essence of the plaintiffs__\nclaim.\n[14]          \nThe defendant and the intervener are arguing in\nthat respect that the FCA does not allow the Court to grant an injunction order\nagainst a province or any remedy that would affect a province__s property rights.\nThey are arguing that that issue was determined by the Federal Court of Appeal\nin Conne\nRiver Band v Canada (1983)\, 49 NR 198 (FCA)\, upheld by the\nSupreme Court of Canada in Joe v Canada\, [1986] 2 SCR 145 (Joe) and\nby the Federal Court of Appeal in Vollant v Canada\, 2009 FCA 185 (Vollant).\nNo distinction can be made\, according to them\, and those precedents apply in\nthis case.\n[15]          \nThe plaintiffs instead suggest that there is a\ndistinction between a claim for Indian title on provincial land (raised in Joe)\,\na claim for Aboriginal rights (raised in Vollant) and having the Court\nrecognize the federal Crown__s duty to consult them and accommodate them when it\nnegotiates agreements that are likely to have an adverse impact on their asserted\nAboriginal rights that are established only prima facie. Even though their\nstatement of claim and written representations are worded in a much broader\nmanner\, the plaintiffs are arguing that their action is restricted to the federal\nCrown__s duty to consult and accommodate and that the Federal Court has\njurisdiction to hear it. \n[16]          \nIf the essence of the plaintiffs__ action was indeed\nthat the federal Crown had failed to consult them before signing the Agreement-in-Principle\nand its duty to consult them before signing the final agreement with the\nGovernment of NFL and the Innu of Labrador\, and if the remedies sought by the plaintiffs\,\nas a result of those violations by the federal Crown\, concerned only the federal\nCrown\, I would agree with the plaintiffs.\n[17]          \nThis Court certainly has substantial\njurisdiction over Aboriginal matters and particularly to recognize the federal\nCrown__s duty to consult and accommodate\, to determine its degree based on the\nquality of the alleged potential Aboriginal rights and to force the federal\nCrown to fulfill its duties (see Sambaa K__e Dene First Nation v Duncan\,\n2012 FC 204 and Huron-Wendat Nation of Wendake v Canada\, 2014 FC 1154). \n[18]          \nThe plaintiffs refer the Court to the Supreme\nCourt of Canada__s decision in Haida Nation v British Columbia (Minister\nof Forests)\, [2004] 3 SCR 511 (Haida)\, in which the source\, scope\nand content of the duty to consult\, as well as when it arises\, were discussed\nin detail. The Chief Justice explained that the duty is grounded in the honour\nof the Crown (federal or provincial) and that it is a procedural duty that arises\nwhen the Crown has knowledge of Aboriginal rights that have been asserted\, but that\nhave still not been defined or proven\, and contemplates conduct that might\nadversely affect those Aboriginal rights\, if eventually proven.\n[19]          \nIt is admitted\, at least by counsel for the Innu\nof Matimekush-Lac John (counsel for the Innu of Uashat mak Manu-Utenam is not\nin agreement)\, that this Court does not have jurisdiction to rule on the plaintiffs__\nsubstantive rights and to confirm their Aboriginal and treaty rights in Labrador.\nBecause such confirmation would have a clear impact on NFL__s property rights in\nthe land and involve several activities under provincial jurisdiction\, only the\nSupreme Court of NFL would have jurisdiction over all of the issues raised by\nsuch an action. It is well known that section 17 of the FCA concerns only the federal\nCrown\, and does not include the provincial Crowns\, and that this Court does not\nhave jurisdiction to issue orders\, of any nature\, against the government of a\nprovince.\n[20]          \nHowever\, a close reading of the plaintiffs__\nstatement of claim and all of the remedies they are seeking before this Court\ninstead reflects a dispute between the plaintiffs\, on the one hand\, and the Innu\nof Labrador and NFL\, on the other hand. Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged\nbefore the Court that in the plaintiffs__ opinion\, the Agreement-in-Principle\ngrants too many rights to the Innu of Labrador in Labrador. Almost all of the relief\nsought by the plaintiffs (with the exception of perhaps paragraphs 3\, 5 and 7\, reproduced\nin paragraph 11 of these reasons) would\, if granted by this Court\, impact the\nrights of the Innu of Labrador and those of NFL\, which are not defendants in\nthe action brought by the plaintiffs.\n[21]          \nFor example\, in paragraph 4 of their conclusions\,\nthe plaintiffs are seeking __[a] declaration that the\nAgreement-in-Principle . . . is unlawful\, unconstitutional and of no force and\neffect with respect to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs__ traditional Innu land\nin Labrador__. Such a conclusion\, clearly\, adversely impacts all of the\nsignatories of the Agreement__in__Principle. \n[22]          \nAs another example\, at paragraph 6 of the relief\nclaimed\, the plaintiffs are seeking __[a] declaration\nand any final agreement or final agreement to settle the land claims covered by\nthe Agreement-in-Principle . . . that is entered into\, without the plaintiffs__\nconsent\, between the Labrador Innu\, Canada and NFL . . . will breach the plaintiffs__\nAboriginal and treaty rights . . . __. To make that\ndeclaration\, this Court would have to confirm\, definitively\, the plaintiffs__\nAboriginal and treaty rights. In Haida\, the following was well stated by\nthe Chief Justice:\n[48] This process does not give Aboriginal\ngroups a veto over what can be done with land pending final proof of the claim.\nThe Aboriginal __consent__ spoken of in Delgamuukw is appropriate only in\ncases of established rights\, and then by no means in every case. . .\n. \n[23]          \nHowever\, because the Aboriginal rights in\nquestion are directly linked to the land of the province of NFL\, the province\nof NFL has a certain interest in any action that would definitively establish\nand prove the plaintiffs__ Aboriginal and treaty rights. \n[24]          \nFor the first issue that arises in the motions\nof the defendant and the intervener\, I find that this Court has jurisdiction to\nrecognize the federal Crown__s duty to consult and accommodate\, to determine its\ndegree based on the quality of the alleged potential Aboriginal rights and to\nforce the federal Crown to fulfill its obligations. However\, those claims are\nonly incidental to the plaintiffs__ action and this Court does not have\njurisdiction over the very essence of their action.\n[25]          \nIn short\, if each allegation that exceeded the\nfactual elements required to demonstrate that the federal Crown has the duty to\nconsult the plaintiffs in its negotiations concerning the land of Labrador\nneeded to be struck from the plaintiffs__ statement of claim\, but especially if\neach of the sought conclusions or remedies that do not arise from a breach of\nthat duty to consult needed to be struck\, the plaintiffs__ action would be\ndistorted and the result would be a multitude of proceedings. It would be\ncontrary to the interests of justice and the parties and to a constructive use\nof judicial resources to allow the plaintiffs__ __cleansed__ action to continue\nbefore this Court and to force the parties to debate a significant portion of\nthe issues raised in their original action before the Supreme Court of NFL. \n-                     \nIs it in the interests of justice to stay the\nplaintiffs__ action so that the issues raised by the plaintiffs can be argued\nbefore the Supreme Court of NFL?\n[26]          \nThe following was well stated by Justice D_cary in\nVollant\, at paragraph 7\, __[t]he striking out of an\nentire statement of claim is nonetheless an extreme remedy in a case in which\nthe Court__s concurrent jurisdiction over some aspects of the dispute has been\nestablished__. In this case\, given my finding that this Court has\njurisdiction over a portion\, even though incidental\, of the plaintiffs__ action\,\nI will exercise my discretion pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the FCA and like\nthe Federal Court of Appeal in Vollant\, I will stay the plaintiffs__\naction before this Court to allow the debate to be pleaded before the Supreme\nCourt of NFL\, between the parties involved in the dispute.\nV.               \nConclusion\n[27]          \nIn light of the foregoing\, the motions of the defendant\nand the intervener will be granted and the matter will be stayed pursuant to\nparagraph 50(1)(b) of the FCA. Given the particular circumstances of\nthis matter and the partial jurisdiction of this Court over the subject of the dispute\,\nregarding the defendant\, costs will be awarded only to the intervener.\n\n\nJUDGMENT\nTHE COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that\n1.                 \nThe motions of the defendant and intervener are\ngranted;\n2.                 \nThe action of the plaintiffs is stayed pursuant\nto paragraph 50(1)(b) of the Federal Courts Act;\n3.                 \nCosts are awarded only to the intervener\, the\nAttorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n__Jocelyne Gagn___\n\nJudge\n\nCertified true translation\nJanine Anderson\,\nTranslator\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL COURT\nSOLICITORS\nOF RECORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOCKET:\n\n\nT-503-13\n\n\n\n\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\n\n\nTHE INNU OF\n  UASHAT MAK MANU-UTENAM ET AL v HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA\n  AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR\n\n\n\n\nPLACE OF HEARING:\n\n\nMontr_al\, QuEbec\n \n\n\n\n\nDATE OF HEARING:\n\n\nApril 8 AND 9\, 2015\n \n\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT\n  AND REASONS:\n\n\nGAGN_ J.\n \n\n\n\n\nDATED:\n\n\nMay 28\, 2015\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPEARANCES: \n\n\n\nJames\n  O'Reilly \nPatrycja\n  Ochman\nMark Phillips\nMarie-Christine\n  Gagnon\nJean-Paul\n  Lacasse \nFran_ois\n  L_vesque\n\n\nFOR\n  THE PLAINTIFFS\n \n\n\n\n\n_ric Gingras\n\n\nFOR\n  THE DEFENDANT\n\n\n\n\nMaxime Faille\n\n\nFOR\n  THE INTERVENER\n\n\n\nSOLICITORS OF RECORD: \n\n\n\nJean-Fran_ois Bertrand\, Avocats\nQu_bec\,\n  Quebec\n\n\nFOR\n  THE PLAINTIFFS\n \n\n\n\n\nWilliam F.
